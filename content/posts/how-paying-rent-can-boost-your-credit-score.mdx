## Introduction

If you’re paying rent every month, you’re already doing one of the most important things lenders look for — making on-time payments. But unless your rent is being reported to the credit bureaus, it **won’t help your credit score**.

The good news is, there are now several ways to **report your rent and build credit** without taking on debt or opening a credit card.

## Why Rent Reporting Matters

Most landlords don’t report rent to credit bureaus by default — which means even if you’ve paid on time for years, your credit file won’t reflect it.

But by using **rent reporting services**, you can:

- Establish credit if you don’t have any  
- Rebuild credit after hardship or debt  
- Improve your credit score to qualify for housing or loans

## How Rent Reporting Works

You (or your landlord) enroll in a service that verifies rent payments and reports them to one or more of the major credit bureaus: **Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax**.

Some popular services include:

- **RentReporters**  
- **Rental Kharma**  
- **Self (rent + credit builder loans)**  
- **LevelCredit**  
- **Esusu** (used by many property managers)

Most services charge a monthly or annual fee — usually $7 to $10/month — though some landlords cover the cost.

> 💡 **Tip:** Reporting rent can’t hurt your credit. It only helps if payments are on time, and missed payments usually aren’t reported.

## Who Should Use Rent Reporting?

Rent reporting is especially helpful if you:

- Have **little or no credit history**  
- Are trying to **rebuild your score** after financial trouble  
- Plan to **apply for a loan**, credit card, or new housing soon  
- Can’t get approved for a secured card

If you're also behind on rent or worried about eviction, look into [Emergency Rental Assistance](./emergency-rental-assistance-what-it-is-and-how-to-apply-before-it-s-gone) first.

## How to Get Started

Here’s how to start reporting your rent:

1. **Ask your landlord or property manager** if they already use a rent reporting system  
2. **Choose a rent reporting service** and enroll (some allow self-reporting)  
3. **Verify your lease and past payments**  
4. **Check your credit report** after a few months to see the impact

Some services even let you report up to 24 months of past rent to give your file a head start.

## Tips for Building Credit Safely

- **Start small**: Avoid high-interest loans or sketchy “credit repair” ads  
- **Monitor your credit**: Use free tools from your bank or [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/)  
- **Pay all bills on time**: Utility and phone bill history may also help your credit if reported

> 💡 **Bonus Tip:** If you're already budgeting rent carefully, rent reporting is one of the **easiest low-risk ways** to build credit — no new debt required.
