## Introduction

Many families in need of food assistance have heard of **WIC** and **SNAP**, but few understand how they differ â€” or that you can actually use both at the same time. These programs are designed to **supplement** your nutrition needs, and knowing how they work can help you make the most of available support.

## What Is SNAP?

The **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**, often called food stamps, provides monthly funds for eligible individuals and families to buy groceries. Benefits are loaded onto an **EBT card** and can be used at most grocery stores and farmers markets.

SNAP benefits can be used to buy:

- Fruits and vegetables
- Meat, poultry, and fish
- Dairy products and bread
- Non-alcoholic beverages

You **cannot** use SNAP for hot foods, alcohol, or non-food items.

## What Is WIC?

**WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)** is a separate program aimed at supporting:

1. Pregnant and postpartum women
2. Infants
3. Children up to age 5

Unlike SNAP, WIC provides **specific foods** that meet nutritional guidelines (like baby formula, milk, whole grains), along with **nutrition education**, **health referrals**, and even **breastfeeding support**.

Benefits are given through WIC cards or checks and can only be used on approved items.

## Can You Get Both WIC and SNAP?

Yes â€” **you can apply for and use both** programs if you meet the eligibility criteria. In fact, many families do.

Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Apply for SNAP** through your stateâ€™s benefits portal
2. **Apply for WIC** through your local WIC office or clinic
3. **Use both EBT and WIC cards** as needed â€” stores will usually process WIC first, then SNAP

Each program has its own income limits and requirements, so qualifying for one does **not** automatically qualify you for the other.

## Key Differences at a Glance

- **SNAP** is for a wide range of low-income individuals and families  
- **WIC** is for women and young children only  
- **SNAP** provides monthly dollars to spend  
- **WIC** provides a set list of approved healthy items  
- **SNAP** is managed by the USDA through state agencies  
- **WIC** is managed locally by health departments and clinics  

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Applying for both programs together can stretch your food budget further â€” and WICâ€™s nutrition support is often overlooked but very helpful.
