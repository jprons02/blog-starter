# The Ultimate Guide to Making Perfect Gingerbread Cookies

# Introduction

Gingerbread cookies are a classic holiday treat that bring joy to both young and old. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about baking and decorating the perfect gingerbread cookies.

## Traditional Recipe

To start, you'll need the following ingredients:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup molasses

Follow these steps to make the dough:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.
2. In another bowl, beat the butter and brown sugar until creamy.
3. Add the egg and molasses to the sugar mixture and beat until well combined.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix until a dough forms.
5. Divide the dough in half, wrap each half in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 2 hours.

## Rolling and Cutting

After the dough has chilled, roll it out on a floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Use gingerbread cookie cutters to cut out shapes and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

## Baking and Decorating

Bake the cookies at 350Â°F for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are set. Once cool, it's time to decorate! Use royal icing, sprinkles, and edible decorations to create festive designs on your gingerbread cookies.

## Storage and Serving

Store your gingerbread cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. These cookies make a wonderful holiday gift or a tasty treat to enjoy with friends and family.

> Pro Tip: For extra flavor, add a hint of orange zest to the dough!
