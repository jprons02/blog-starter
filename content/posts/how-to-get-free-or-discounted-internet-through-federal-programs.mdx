## Quick wins you can try today
- **Check for Lifeline eligibility** (income-based or via programs like SNAP/Medicaid). If you qualify, you can apply the discount to home internet or mobile service.
- **Call your current ISP and ask for their low-income plan.** Many providers keep $10‚Äì$30 options; ask whether combining with Lifeline is allowed.
- **One-per-household rule tip:** If roommates have separate finances, clarify separate ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù at the address to avoid denials.
- **Document now, decide faster:** Keep a single file with ID, address proof, and program participation to speed up verification.
- **If you‚Äôre in a Tribal area:** Ask specifically about enhanced benefits and participating providers serving your location.

## After ACP: the programs and workarounds that still lower your bill
When ACP ended, the monthly subsidy disappeared‚Äîbut a few levers remain that can meaningfully cut costs.
- **Lifeline is ongoing:** A smaller monthly discount remains available and can be applied to internet or bundled service; some carriers let you stack it with low-income plans.
- **Provider specials:** ISPs often run regional promos; a quick call to the ‚Äúretentions‚Äù or ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù line can reveal offers not shown online.
- **Library & school hotspots:** Many systems lend Wi-Fi hotspots you can keep for weeks‚Äîuse this as a bridge while benefits are processed.
- **Equipment hacks:** Modem/router rental fees add up; a one-time purchase can pay for itself within a year.
- **Data-cap math:** Track your actual monthly usage; a cheaper tier may fit once you remove rental fees and autopay discounts kick in.

## Address mismatches & one-per-household: how to prevent denials
Identity checks and address validation are the biggest reasons applications stall‚Äîfix these before you submit.
- **Use the exact USPS address format** (include apartment/unit). Even small differences can trigger duplicated-household flags.
- **Shared addresses:** For multi-unit homes or shelters, request an **address exception** form to prove separate households.
- **Name consistency:** Match the name on your ID, utility bill, and any eligibility documents to avoid manual reviews.
- **Keep a timeline log:** Note submission dates, upload confirmations, and phone calls; reference this if you need escalation.
- **If denied:** Ask which data element failed (address, program verification, identity) and correct just that piece‚Äîthen reapply.

## FAQs 

### Can I still get a federal discount after ACP ended?
Yes, through **Lifeline** if you qualify. You may also find ISP low-income plans and local hotspot lending as a bridge.

### Can roommates each qualify?
If you buy and prepare food separately and manage finances independently, you may be separate ‚Äúhouseholds.‚Äù Be ready to document separate units or budgets.

### Does mobile internet count?
Lifeline can apply to mobile or home service. If home broadband isn‚Äôt available or is too costly, a mobile plan can be a workable interim option.

### What if my application says there‚Äôs already a benefit at my address?
Request an address exception to show separate households (e.g., apartment splits, informal units, or shelters).
