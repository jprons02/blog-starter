## Introduction

Whether itâ€™s job applications, online learning, or telehealth â€” internet access is no longer optional. For many low-income households, the **Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)** can make internet service **free or affordable**, thanks to a federal benefit that supports both broadband and device access.

## What Is the Affordable Connectivity Program?

The ACP is a benefit from the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** designed to reduce internet costs for qualifying families.

Hereâ€™s what the program offers:

- **Up to $30/month off** your internet bill  
- **Up to $75/month off** for households on tribal land  
- A **one-time $100 discount** for a laptop, tablet, or desktop (with co-pay)

You can combine this benefit with participating broadband providers, and some even offer $0/month plans using ACP.

## Who Qualifies for ACP?

You may qualify if **anyone in your household** is enrolled in:

- SNAP (Food Stamps)
- Medicaid
- SSI
- WIC
- Free or reduced-price school meals
- Federal Pell Grant (current year)
- Lifeline

You may also qualify based on income â€” typically at or below **200% of the federal poverty level**.

## How to Apply for ACP

1. **Go to GetInternet.gov** to start the application  
2. **Check your eligibility** through the National Verifier  
3. **Apply online**, by mail, or with a participating internet provider  
4. **Choose a provider** offering ACP-supported plans  
5. **Enroll and activate** your discount  

If approved, your benefit is applied directly to your monthly bill.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Already getting Lifeline? You can combine it with ACP for even more savings â€” and skip parts of the application.

## Providers Offering Free or Discounted Internet

Some providers that participate in ACP:

- **Xfinity/Comcast**
- **AT&T**
- **T-Mobile**
- **Verizon**
- **Spectrum**
- **Optimum**
- **Local ISPs and community broadband providers**

Make sure to confirm ACP compatibility before signing up.
