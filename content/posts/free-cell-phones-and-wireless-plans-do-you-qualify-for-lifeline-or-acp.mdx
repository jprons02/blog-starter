## Quick wins you can try today
- **Check your lane:** ACP has ended for now, but **Lifeline** is active nationwide and on Tribal lands; many households still qualify via income or participation in programs like SNAP/Medicaid.
- **Make a docs bundle:** photo ID, address, proof of eligibility (benefit letter or income), and last four digits of SSN or alternative ID‚Äîsaved as clear PDFs/photos.
- **Pick a participating carrier (e.g., SafeLink) and start the application.** If a document is missing, submit what you have and upload the rest promptly.
- **One-per-household rule:** confirm no one at your address is already using the same benefit; use the program‚Äôs household worksheet if asked.
- **Keep a simple log:** dates, who you spoke with, confirmation numbers‚Äîhandy for follow-ups or recertification.
- **If you had ACP before:** ask your carrier what your plan looks like **now** under Lifeline-only and whether you must opt in to keep service.

## ACP ended‚ÄîLifeline remains: what actually changed in 2024‚Äì2025
- **The big shift:** ACP‚Äôs monthly internet/phone discount wound down due to funding; providers adjusted plans. **Lifeline did not end** and continues as a separate benefit.
- **What to expect now:** benefit amounts and included features differ from ACP; expect **leaner plans** unless your carrier offers an add-on or a separate low-cost plan.
- **Who still qualifies:** Lifeline eligibility hinges on **income (typically ‚â§135% FPG)** or participation in qualifying programs; Tribal benefits may be higher.
- **Timing matters:** if your ACP-linked plan changed, carriers may ask you to **affirm** continuing service or migrate to a Lifeline plan‚Äîmissed notices can interrupt service.
- **Pro move:** call support and ask, ‚ÄúWhat exact plan do I have today without ACP, and what proofs do you still need from me?‚Äù

## Same address, different result: why state rules and carrier plans don‚Äôt match
- **Different administrators, different details:** states can have unique processes layered on top of federal rules; carriers also tailor plans by coverage and costs.
- **Verification quirks:** address formatting, apartment/suite numbers, or mismatched names can trigger flags; match your documents exactly.
- **Device options vary:** some carriers supply SIM-only; others offer refurbished phones‚Äîask what‚Äôs included before you switch.
- **Keep your number:** request number porting if you change carriers; gather your account number/PIN from the old provider first.
- **Tribal lands & special cases:** enhanced Lifeline support or alternate proofs may apply; ask specifically about Tribal eligibility in your area.
