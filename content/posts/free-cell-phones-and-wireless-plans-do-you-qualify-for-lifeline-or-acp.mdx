## Understanding SafeLink and ACP

### What is the SafeLink Wireless Program?

**SafeLink Wireless** is a service provided by TracFone Wireless under the **Lifeline program**, a long-standing federal initiative that offers free or discounted phone service to eligible low-income individuals. SafeLink provides a **free smartphone and monthly plan** that includes talk, text, and data for those who qualify.

> SafeLink is not a separate government program â€” it is a Lifeline provider. Some providers, like SafeLink, also participate in ACP to offer expanded benefits.

### What is the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)?

The **ACP** is a newer federal benefit program launched by the FCC. It helps eligible households afford internet service and connected devices by providing:

- **Up to $30/month** toward internet service (or up to $75/month for households on Tribal lands)
- A **one-time discount of up to $100** for a laptop, desktop, or tablet, if the household contributes between $10â€“$50

Many Lifeline providers, including SafeLink, participate in both programs â€” allowing eligible users to **stack** benefits for better phone and internet access.
