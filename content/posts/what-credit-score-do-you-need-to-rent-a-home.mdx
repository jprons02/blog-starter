## Landlords look past the number—here’s how to pass screening even if your score isn’t perfect.

Worried your score will sink your rental? The truth: most places don’t use a single cutoff. Here’s how credit fits into screening—and what to do if you’re not at 700. <IfLocation>For readers in <City/>, <State/>, notices, deposit options, and appeal steps can vary—use local guidance to plan your approach.</IfLocation>

## Start here: what to do first

- List your strengths: stable income (typically 2.5–3× rent), on-time bill history, solid references, no evictions, clean criminal court records. You’ll use this to balance a “just-OK” score.
- Pull your own credit reports and fix errors before you apply (disputes can remove wrong addresses, duplicate collections, or paid debts).
- Build a simple “renter packet”: ID, last 3 pay stubs, offer letter or benefits award, last 2 bank statements, past landlord contacts, and a 1–2 paragraph cover note explaining anything unusual.
- Have plan B ready: a co-signer/guarantor, larger deposit, or a few months of rent in savings can offset a middling score.
- If you’re credit invisible/thin file, bring proof of positive history (on-time utilities, phone, or rent receipts) and consider rent-reporting to build score over time.

## There’s usually no hard minimum: how rental risk scoring actually works

**Tiny scenario:** Two applicants both show “650.” One has medical collections from years ago but steady income and clean rentals; the other has recent missed payments and high debt. The first may get approved faster.

- Property managers may use **rental-specific models** (e.g., a “resident score”) that weigh factors differently than standard credit scores.
- Many screens look at **patterns**—recent delinquencies, high credit utilization, or unresolved collections matter more than an old paid account.
- Income and **debt-to-income** can weigh heavily; some buildings require a specific income multiple regardless of score.
- **Evictions/judgments** and open bankruptcies are bigger red flags than a single low number.
- Expect variation by **market and building class**: corporate-managed buildings may set higher thresholds than small landlords.
- If you’re denied, you have a right to an **adverse action notice** telling you which report/score was used and how to request it.

## Renting with less-than-perfect credit: practical ways to say “yes”

**Tiny scenario:** Your score is 605 after a rough patch. You offer a co-signer, provide two months’ bank statements showing cash cushion, and agree to enroll in autopay; the landlord approves with a slightly higher deposit.

- **Strengthen the file:** stable income letters, proof of emergency savings, and clean rental history references.
- **Offer risk-reducers:** larger deposit (where legal), a few months’ rent upfront, autopay, or a **co-signer/guarantor** (understand fees and obligations).
- **Target the right listings:** smaller owners may review the whole story; large complexes may be stricter but offer “conditional approvals.”
- **Time your application:** apply right after a paycheck hits and credit utilization dips (balances lower = often a small score bump).
- **Explain the “why”:** a brief, factual note about medical bills, divorce, or a one-time lapse—paired with proof of current stability—can matter.
- **Build as you go:** enroll in **rent reporting** so on-time payments help your profile for future moves.

## FAQs 
### Is 600 enough to rent?
Often, yes—especially with strong income, clean rental history, or added safeguards (co-signer, larger deposit). Requirements vary by building and market.

### Why is the score on my rental app different from my bank app?
Landlords may use rental-focused models or a different score version/date. Expect variation; decisions also consider your full report and income.

### Can I get approved with no credit history?
Sometimes. Bring proof of income and positive payment records (e.g., utilities). A co-signer or rent-reporting can help first-time renters.
