## Introduction

Looking for a new place to live but worried about your credit score? You’re not alone. Many renters fear being denied housing because of bad or limited credit — but the reality is more flexible than you might think.

While landlords do consider your credit, it's only **one piece of the puzzle**. There are ways to rent even with low or no credit — and smart steps you can take to improve your chances.

## What Credit Score Do Landlords Look For?

There’s no single “pass or fail” credit score required to rent — but here are some general trends:

- **Above 700**: Strong score — usually no issues  
- **620–699**: Fair score — often accepted with good income or rental history  
- **Below 620**: Risk zone — may need extra documentation or a co-signer  

Some landlords use your full credit report to look at **payment history, collections, or debt**, not just your score. Corporate apartment complexes tend to be stricter than private landlords.

## Can You Rent with No Credit or Bad Credit?

Yes — but it depends on the situation. Here are some ways to improve your chances:

- **Offer a larger security deposit**  
- **Provide proof of income or savings**  
- **Use a co-signer or guarantor**  
- **Share references from past landlords**  
- **Write a letter of explanation** (especially after medical bills or job loss)

Programs like [rent reporting](./how-paying-rent-can-boost-your-credit-score) can also help build credit over time.

If you’re facing a housing crisis or denial, check if you're eligible for [Emergency Rental Assistance](./emergency-rental-assistance-what-it-is-and-how-to-apply-before-it-s-gone) or [Section 8](./section-8-housing-explained-how-to-get-help-paying-rent).

## What Landlords Really Care About

Most landlords are looking for **reliable, financially stable tenants**. That often includes:

- Steady monthly income (usually 2–3× the rent)  
- On-time payment history (rent, loans, or utilities)  
- Clean or explainable background check  
- Good communication and references

Credit score is a factor — but not always the dealbreaker people assume.

## Tips to Improve Approval Odds

If you're applying to rent with less-than-perfect credit:

- **Apply to independent landlords**: They're more flexible than property managers  
- **Be honest**: A clear explanation of your credit history shows responsibility  
- **Fix errors fast**: Dispute incorrect items at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com)  
- **Build credit proactively**: Tools like secured cards or rent reporting can help

> 💡 **Tip:** You don’t need perfect credit to rent — you just need to show that you’ll pay on time. Landlords want good tenants, not perfect numbers.
