## The rules are moving fast, but there are still smart steps you can take today.

Student loan forgiveness has been at the center of court fights, policy rollbacks, and last-minute pauses over the past few months, leaving many borrowers unsure whether relief is coming or disappearing. This guide focuses on what’s actually changed recently, what hasn’t, and how working-class borrowers can protect themselves from costly mistakes.

## Start here: what to do first if forgiveness feels uncertain
If you’re feeling whiplash from the headlines, you’re not alone. The most important thing is to separate **paused programs** from **programs that still count your progress**.

- Stay enrolled in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan if you qualify, even if parts of forgiveness are temporarily blocked.
- Keep making required payments unless your servicer confirms a forbearance in writing.
- Save copies of payment histories, employment certifications, and servicer messages.
- Ignore unsolicited calls or emails promising “guaranteed” forgiveness for a fee.
- Check your Federal Student Aid account regularly for official notices—not just servicer emails.

## Court rulings, pauses, and pivots: what actually changed in the last few months
A key non-obvious detail from recent litigation is that **courts have targeted specific forgiveness paths—not the entire repayment system**.

*Example:* A borrower on an IDR plan may still earn credit toward forgiveness even while a particular plan’s cancellation authority is frozen.

- Parts of the SAVE plan’s forgiveness provisions were paused by federal courts in 2024–2025.
- Monthly payment calculations under IDR often continued, even when forgiveness timing became unclear.
- Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) remained rooted in statute, making it harder to fully dismantle.
- One-time account adjustments credited past payments for many long-time borrowers.
- Confusion increased because servicers applied pauses unevenly across accounts.

## The money math most people miss: how delays quietly raise long-term costs
The biggest hidden risk isn’t losing forgiveness outright—it’s **time**.

*Example:* A borrower earning $38,000 may owe $0 per month under IDR, but a missed recertification can trigger a higher bill and reset interest subsidies.

- Missed income recertification can push you into a standard plan temporarily.
- Interest may capitalize during certain administrative changes.
- Forbearance can pause payments but still allow balances to grow.
- Delays disproportionately affect borrowers with smaller balances but longer timelines.
- Older borrowers nearing forgiveness are often hit hardest by last-minute rule changes.

## Why servicer bottlenecks matter more than politics right now
Even when rules technically favor borrowers, **capacity problems** can block access.

*Example:* During recent transitions, some servicers took months to process simple IDR updates, leaving borrowers in limbo.

- Staffing shortages slowed form processing and call response times.
- Automated systems lagged behind policy changes.
- Incorrect bills were common after repayment restarts.
- Written complaints created paper trails that helped resolve errors.
- Borrowers who escalated early often avoided months of overbilling.

> “The reality is, is that the SAVE plan was created because the other plans were unaffordable for millions of borrowers. So many borrowers are going to be in the difficult spot of making this decision about whether or not to stay current on their loans or feed their families and keep a roof over their head.”

<IfNoLocation>

### Is student loan forgiveness completely gone?
No. Some programs are paused or limited, but others—like PSLF and IDR credit—still exist under federal law.

### Should I stop paying my loans until this is resolved?
Only if your servicer confirms a forbearance or $0 payment in writing. Stopping payments on your own can cause delinquency.

### Do past payments still count if forgiveness is delayed?
In many cases, yes. Recent adjustments credited prior payments even when cancellation timelines were uncertain.
