## Start here: what to do first

- Call or visit your nearest American Job Center and ask for a WIOA eligibility screening.  
- Bring basics: ID, proof of address, recent pay stubs (or layoff notice), rÃ©sumÃ© (even if rough).  
- Share your target job and any barriers (transportation, childcare, tools). This unlocks supportive services.  
- Ask for a skills assessment and labor-market check to confirm training leads to real openings.  
- If training makes sense, request an outline of steps and timelines (orientation â†’ paperwork â†’ approval).

## How Individual Training Accounts workâ€”and how to choose a school wisely

WIOA often pays tuition through an **Individual Training Account (ITA)**, which is a capped training budget tied to *approved* providers and programs.

*Scenario:* You want a medical billing job but lack credentials. An advisor helps you pick an approved course; your ITA pays the school directly once you enroll.

- ITAs typically require your program to be on the stateâ€™s Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL).  
- Funding isnâ€™t unlimited: expect caps, co-pays in some areas, or priority for certain jobseekers.  
- Compare outcomes: completion rates, job placement, and median wages by programâ€”ask your advisor to pull them.  
- Supportive services (transport passes, uniforms, exam fees) may be added to your plan if theyâ€™re a barrier.  
- Always verify refund policies and externship details before signing school paperwork.  
- For the legal nuts and bolts, the ITA is defined in federal rules under WIOA Title I (see the **Individual Training Accounts** regulation on ecfr.gov).

## Dislocated Worker Grants: extra help after layoffs or disasters

When big layoffs or disasters hit, **National Dislocated Worker Grants (DWGs)** can add slots for training and temporary jobs.

*Scenario:* Your plant closes. Your AJC may offer short-term paid disaster-recovery work while you retrain for a CDL or HVAC license.

- DWGs expand services beyond regular WIOA funding when communities face unusual job loss.  
- You may qualify if you were laid off, self-employed but lost work due to an event, or a long-term unemployed worker.  
- Expect accelerated intake and targeted training aligned with in-demand jobs (logistics, construction, healthcare).  
- Paid work experience or transitional jobs can bridge income while you skill up.  
- Ask specifically whether your area has an active DWG and what occupations it supports.  
- Learn more about DWGs and eligibility on the U.S. Department of Labor site.

## FAQs
### Who can qualify for WIOA help?
Adults with low income, dislocated workers after layoffs, and many out-of-school youth can qualify. Local priority rules may apply.

### Do I have to pay anything back?
Noâ€”WIOA funds are not loans. You might have modest costs (e.g., exam fees) if your area doesnâ€™t cover them.

### How long does approval take?
It varies by area. Expect a few appointments for eligibility, career planning, and provider approval before training starts.

### Can WIOA help if I already have a degree?
Yes, if you need new skills to re-enter in-demand work or after a layoff. Your plan must show a clear path to employment.
