## Introduction

If youâ€™ve been laid off, are underemployed, or want to switch careers, thereâ€™s a government program that can help you retrain â€” for free.

The **Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)** funds job training programs, apprenticeships, and career services across the U.S. Itâ€™s designed to help workers find in-demand jobs and boost long-term income.

## What Is WIOA?

WIOA is a federal program that supports workforce development. It offers **free access to job training, resume help, certifications, and career counseling** through local job centers.

You may qualify for:

- Tuition for vocational training or certifications
- Paid apprenticeships and on-the-job training
- Help with resumes, interviews, and job search
- Transportation or childcare support while training

Programs are available in fields like healthcare, manufacturing, IT, and more â€” all tied to your local job market.

## Who Can Use WIOA Services?

You may qualify if you:

1. Have been **laid off or furloughed**
2. Are **unemployed or receiving unemployment benefits**
3. Are **low-income or receiving public assistance**
4. Are an **out-of-school youth or young adult (ages 16â€“24)**
5. Need new skills to stay employed or change careers

Eligibility rules vary slightly by state and program, but WIOA is open to a wide range of people â€” not just those on unemployment.

## How to Apply for WIOA Job Training

Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. **Visit your nearest American Job Center** (search via CareerOneStop)
2. **Request an eligibility assessment** for WIOA services
3. **Meet with a career counselor** to build a training plan
4. **Apply for approved training programs or apprenticeships**

Some states also allow you to apply online or by phone. If youâ€™re already receiving unemployment, mention that â€” it may fast-track your application.

## Tips for Job Seekers

- **Ask about priority status**: WIOA prioritizes veterans, single parents, and those on public assistance
- **Choose in-demand fields**: Ask your counselor which careers have strong local hiring
- **Use all the services**: Many job centers offer free workshops and job fairs too

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** WIOA doesnâ€™t just help with schooling â€” it helps you land a job after. Some centers even offer direct employer connections.
