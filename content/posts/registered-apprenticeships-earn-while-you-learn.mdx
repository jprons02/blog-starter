## Get paid to train with a mentor, classroom instruction, and a nationally recognized credential.

Registered Apprenticeships are real jobs with a training plan: you earn a wage from day one, learn on the job with a mentor, and complete short classes that lead to a portable credential. If you want a debt-free path into a solid career, this is one of the most reliable ways to do it.

## Tools & links worth saving for your apprenticeship search

- **Apprenticeship Job Finder (official):** <a href="https://www.apprenticeship.gov/apprenticeship-job-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search openings on Apprenticeship.gov</a>.
- **American Job Center (AJC):** Get free help with applications, r√©sum√© edits, and interview prep; ask about supportive services for tools, boots, transit, or child care.
- **State apprenticeship office:** Check your state‚Äôs sponsor list, entrance requirements, and testing or age rules.
- **Community colleges & training providers:** Ask about **pre-apprenticeship** paths that strengthen your application and may cover class costs.
- **Union halls & trade associations:** Many trades recruit directly; visit in person to ask about entry windows and aptitude tests.
- **Employer career sites + alerts:** Apply with large local employers and set job alerts so you‚Äôre first in line when cohorts open.

## Progressive wages, class hours, and schedules: what ‚Äúearn while you learn‚Äù really looks like

A Registered Apprenticeship combines paid on-the-job learning with short ‚Äúrelated instruction‚Äù and guaranteed raises as you build skills. *Example:* a first-year electrician apprentice might start near 40‚Äì60% of the journey wage and receive scheduled bumps each 6‚Äì12 months as competencies are signed off.

- **On-the-job learning (OJL).** Time-based programs commonly use **~2,000 hours of OJL per year**; hybrid and competency-based programs blend hours with skill sign-offs.
- **Related instruction (class).** Programs **recommend ~144 hours of class per year**, often evenings or online; some award college credit toward a certificate or degree.
- **Wage progression is required.** Standards include a **progressively increasing wage schedule**‚Äîyour pay rises as you hit training milestones.
- **Mentorship.** You train under a qualified journeyworker who signs off when you‚Äôre proficient on specific tasks.
- **Keep records.** Save pay stubs and class transcripts; you‚Äôll need them if you switch employers or request credit for prior experience.
- **Completion = credential.** Finishing earns a **nationally recognized credential** that many employers treat like a journey card.

## WIOA can cover books, tools, and other supports‚Äîhow it connects to apprenticeships

Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs at your AJC can co-enroll apprentices to reduce out-of-pocket costs. *Scenario:* a parent starting a medical assistant apprenticeship gets help paying for scrubs, exam fees, and bus passes while attending evening classes.

- **Eligible training.** Registered Apprenticeship counts as a qualifying training option for adults, dislocated workers, and youth.
- **Supportive services.** Depending on your situation and local policy, WIOA can help with **books, supplies, tools, uniforms, child care, and transportation** so you can stay on track.
- **Co-enrollment.** You can receive AJC job-search help *and* apprenticeship wages while getting training funds or supports.
- **Ask early.** Meet with an AJC career navigator before you start to build an **Individual Employment Plan** and avoid delays.
- **Bring proof.** Offer letter, class schedule, estimated costs, and income documentation help your case move faster.
- **Stay eligible.** Keep up with any required check-ins and submit receipts promptly so supports don‚Äôt pause mid-program.
