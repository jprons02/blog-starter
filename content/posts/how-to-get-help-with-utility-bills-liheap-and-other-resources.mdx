## What Is LIHEAP?

The **Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)** is a federally funded initiative that helps households with:

- **Heating and cooling bills**  
- **Crisis assistance** during shutoff notices  
- **Weatherization improvements**

The program is administered at the **state and local level**, and eligibility depends on your household size and income.

## Start here: what to do first
- **Submit an application now** to lock your place in line; you can upload missing paperwork after you get a case number.
- **Build a ‚Äúproof packet‚Äù:** photo ID, address, recent utility bill, account number, income for all adults, and any shutoff/disconnect notices.
- **Call your utility‚Äôs assistance line** and ask for a **payment plan or medical hold** while your LIHEAP is pending.
- **Note special situations:** seniors, people with disabilities, and households with young children may get priority during extreme weather.
- **Keep a simple log:** dates, who you spoke with, confirmation numbers, and what documents you sent.

## ‚ÄúShutoff clocks‚Äù and grace periods: how to buy time (and avoid fees)
When a disconnection notice drops, timing and documentation matter.
- **Act within the window on the notice.** Many utilities pause shutoffs if you prove you‚Äôve applied for aid or entered a payment plan.
- **Crisis appointments exist.** If you have a disconnect notice, ask for a **crisis slot** and be ready with your bill and ID at check-in.
- **Medical protections.** A note from a licensed provider can trigger temporary protection for medically vulnerable customers.
- **Partial payments help.** Even a small good-faith payment can reduce fees and show you‚Äôre actively resolving the balance.
- **Tiny scenario:** You upload your application receipt and a payment plan agreement the same day the notice arrives‚Äîshutoff is paused while the case is reviewed.

## State rules, different outcomes: why your neighbor qualified and you didn‚Äôt
LIHEAP is federal funding with **state-run rules**, so eligibility and processes vary.
- **Fuel type matters.** Households using delivered fuels (oil/propane) may access different crisis help than electric-only homes.
- **Seasonality shifts priority.** Some states emphasize heating season; others have summer cooling programs and heat-mitigation rules.
- **Documentation flavors.** One state may require the lease; another may accept a landlord statement. Follow your state checklist exactly.
- **Income lookback periods differ.** Thirty-day vs. annual income reviews can change results‚Äîask which window your state uses.
- **Appeals exist.** If denied, request the written reason, correct that element (income proof, household size, address), and reapply.

## FAQs
  
### How fast can LIHEAP help?
Crisis appointments can move quickly‚Äîespecially with a shutoff notice. Standard applications may take longer; submit now to secure your place.

### What if I rent and utilities are in my landlord‚Äôs name?
Ask whether your state accepts landlord statements or account affidavits. Many programs can still assist if the bill is tied to your unit.

### Can I apply if my income just dropped?
Yes. Note the change on your application and include recent pay stubs or a separation letter so your **current** situation is clear.

### What if I already owe fees?
Request fee waivers when you set up a payment plan and show proof you‚Äôve applied for assistance.
