## Introduction

If youâ€™re struggling to keep the lights on or the heat running, youâ€™re not alone. High energy bills can hit low-income families the hardest â€” especially in the summer or winter months. Fortunately, **LIHEAP** and other programs exist to help you cover the cost of electricity, gas, and other utilities.

## What Is LIHEAP?

The **Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)** is a federally funded initiative that helps households with:

- **Heating and cooling bills**
- **Crisis assistance** during shutoff notices
- **Weatherization improvements**

The program is administered at the **state and local level**, and eligibility depends on your household size and income.

## Who Qualifies for LIHEAP?

Each state sets its own income limits, but you generally qualify if your income is at or below **150% of the federal poverty level**.

Other qualifying factors may include:

1. Receiving benefits like SNAP, SSI, or TANF
2. Being a senior, disabled, or having a young child in the home
3. Having a shutoff notice or no heating/cooling

Some states also offer priority assistance for emergencies, seniors, or families with children.

## How to Apply for Utility Assistance

Applying for LIHEAP or similar programs is usually straightforward:

1. **Find your stateâ€™s LIHEAP office** or benefits website
2. **Gather documentation** like ID, income verification, and utility bills
3. **Submit an application online or in person**
4. **Follow up** if you donâ€™t hear back in a week or two

In many cases, funds are paid directly to the utility company on your behalf.

## Other Utility Help Programs

- **Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)**: Helps improve energy efficiency
- **Local utility company hardship funds**: Many power/gas companies offer their own emergency aid
- **Nonprofits like the Salvation Army or 211.org** often provide energy assistance or referrals

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Even if you think you donâ€™t qualify, apply anyway â€” some states offer tiered benefits, and crisis situations can override income thresholds.
