## Start here: what to do first
- **Check the basics.** States set income limits (never above **85% of State Median Income**) and require a parent to be working, looking for work, or in approved school/training. Kids are generally **under 13** (older if the child has certain disabilities). Eligibility typically lasts **12 months** before recertification.
- **Know your timeline.** Once approved, assistance usually continues through the 12-month period even if hours or pay fluctuate modestly. Ask which changes you must report during the year.
- **Choose eligible care.** Most licensed centers and family child-care homes‚Äîand some license-exempt relatives who meet health/safety checks‚Äîcan be covered. Ask about **enhanced rates** for infants, nontraditional hours, or special needs.
- **Expect a sliding copay.** Families pay a share based on income and household size; some states **waive** copays for the lowest-income families or in specific circumstances.
- **Prep your paperwork.** Common items: ID, proof of address, recent pay stubs or benefits letters, school/training schedule (if applicable), child‚Äôs age, and your chosen provider‚Äôs info.

## The Copay Cliff: How a $1 Raise Can Spike Your Child Care Bill
- **Why it happens.** States set entry/exit thresholds and copay scales; crossing the **exit threshold** or recertifying at a higher income can end or reduce your subsidy.
- **Plan around recertification.** If you can, time new hours or promotions **after approval** so you get continuity until the next redetermination.
- **Ask about phase-outs.** Some states soften the cliff with **higher ‚Äúexit‚Äù limits** or temporary policies that cap copays for certain families.
- **Reality check on provider charges.** If state reimbursement is below local tuition, you may still owe a gap. Confirm whether a provider **accepts the subsidy** and whether extra fees apply.
- *Tiny scenario:* A parent gets a small raise two months before recertification. Their copay rises slightly but the subsidy continues through the 12-month period, avoiding a sudden jump to full tuition.

## State Rules, Different Outcomes: Why Your Neighbor Qualifies and You Don‚Äôt
- **Different names, same funding.** States brand CCDF under local names, but the core rules come from the same federal law.
- **Income math varies.** Many states set **60‚Äì85% of SMI** as the entry threshold and may use **higher ‚Äúexit‚Äù limits** so small raises don‚Äôt cut aid immediately.
- **Redetermination & reporting.** All states provide **12-month eligibility**, but mid-year reporting triggers differ (e.g., only ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù changes vs. more frequent updates).
- **Waitlists & priorities.** Some places keep **waitlists** and prioritize very low-income families, children with disabilities or in protective services, or parents in training programs.
- **Provider access.** Payment rates rely on **market-rate surveys or alternative methods**; low rates can reduce provider participation. Ask about **differentials** for infants, nonstandard hours, or higher-quality settings.
- <IfLocation><em>In <State/>: look up your sliding-fee scale, renewal timing, and whether your county uses a waitlist.</em></IfLocation>

Most licensed providers‚Äîand some license-exempt relatives who meet health/safety checks‚Äîcan qualify. Ask about enhanced rates for infants, nontraditional hours, or special needs.
