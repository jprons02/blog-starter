## Start Here: What to Do First
- **Confirm eligibility** with your state/territory program (income, work/school status, child‚Äôs age, and residency are common checks).
- **Gather documents**: IDs, proof of income or benefits, work/school schedule, child‚Äôs birth certificate, and recent bills you may need to verify circumstances.
- **Apply early** and **opt into alerts**: some areas use waitlists or brief application windows‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss notifications.
- **Plan your provider list**: line up several licensed or approved providers that accept subsidies so you have options if your first choice is full.
- **Track everything**: keep a simple log (dates, providers contacted, outcomes). This helps with follow-ups and any extension requests.

## How It Works (Program Mechanics)
- **Who runs it**: CCDF is federal funding managed by your state or territory‚Äôs lead agency; local partners may process applications and payments.
- **What it covers**: a portion of your child care cost for eligible children, typically for at least 12 months once approved.
- **How payment flows**: you pay a family copay or share; the program pays the rest directly to your provider (rules vary by state).
- **Choosing care**: pick a qualifying provider (licensed center, family child care, or eligible relative/non-traditional options where allowed).
- **Redetermination**: you‚Äôll re-verify after your eligibility period; report changes your agency requires (e.g., job changes, address).

## Tips, Hacks & Best Practices
- **Be application-ready**: keep digital scans of documents to upload fast; delays often happen when paperwork is incomplete.
- **Ask about grace periods**: some programs allow job searches, shift changes, or short gaps without losing your spot‚Äîknow your local rules.
- **Confirm provider payments**: understand how and when your provider gets paid so billing issues don‚Äôt bounce back to you.
- **Keep backups**: waitlists move‚Äîmaintain a short list of alternate providers in nearby neighborhoods.
- **Build goodwill**: a brief ‚Äúfamily profile‚Äù (work/school schedule, reliable pickup plan, emergency contacts) helps providers say yes.
