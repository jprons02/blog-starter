## Introduction

Childcare can cost more than rent in many cities — and it’s one of the biggest barriers for low-income families trying to work, go to school, or get back on their feet.

But if you're struggling to afford daycare or after-school care, there's help available. The **Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)** is a government program that can pay part (or all) of your childcare costs depending on your income and situation.

## What Is CCDF?

The **Child Care and Development Fund** is a federal program that provides money to states to help families pay for childcare. It’s often run under different names at the state level, like “Child Care Assistance Program” or “Subsidized Child Care.”

CCDF funds can be used for:

- Licensed daycare centers
- Family child care homes
- Approved relatives or in-home providers
- After-school programs

Payments usually go directly to the provider, and many families just pay a small copay or nothing at all.

## Who Qualifies for Child Care Assistance?

Eligibility varies by state, but in general you must:

1. Be **working, in school, or in job training**
2. Have a **child under age 13** (or under 19 if disabled)
3. Have **low or moderate income** (usually under 85% of state median income)

Many states prioritize:

- Families with very young children
- Single parents
- Families experiencing homelessness
- Parents transitioning off TANF or other benefits

## How to Apply for Child Care Help

Application processes differ by state, but here’s how to start:

1. **Find your state’s child care subsidy office** (search “[your state] child care assistance”)
2. **Gather documents**: proof of income, work/school schedule, child’s age, and provider info
3. **Submit an application** online or through a local agency
4. **Follow up** and complete interviews if required

Some states have waitlists, so apply early and ask about temporary coverage while waiting.

## Tips for Parents

- **Choose your provider wisely**: Not all childcare options are approved — make sure they’re licensed or registered
- **Ask about emergency coverage**: Some states offer expedited help for newly employed parents
- **Keep reapplying**: Many subsidies require re-certification every 6–12 months

> 💡 **Tip:** Even if you think you make “too much,” check your state’s income limits. Many middle-income families still qualify — especially with multiple kids or part-time work.
