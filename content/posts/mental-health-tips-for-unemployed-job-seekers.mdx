## Quick wins you can try today

- **Shrink the day.** Pick one must-do (job search), one should-do (skill or portfolio), one could-do (walk, call a friend). Stop after those three.  
- **Set a quit time.** Give your brain a clear off-switch to prevent burnout and rumination.  
- **Create a tiny streak.** Ten minutes of focused practice or outreach, daily. Track it with a paper calendar and mark it boldly.  
- **Use the 2‚Äì2‚Äì2 outreach rule.** Two former coworkers, two acquaintances, two ‚Äúlong shots‚Äù each week. Keep notes so follow-ups are easy.  
- **Move first, scroll later.** A brisk walk or stretch before opening email or job boards.

## The setback loop: why rejection hits harder after week three‚Äîand how to break it

When responses slow down, the brain predicts more disappointment and dodges effort (‚Äúwhy try?‚Äù). That avoidance briefly lowers stress, then makes motivation crater.

**Tiny scenario:** You don‚Äôt hear back from three applications. You skip outreach for a few days and feel worse by Friday.

- **Name the loop.** Say it out loud: ‚ÄúAvoidance gives short relief, long drag.‚Äù  
- **Switch to process goals.** ‚ÄúFive quality applications‚Äù beats ‚Äúget an interview.‚Äù You control inputs, not outcomes.  
- **Batch the sting.** Check rejections once a day, not all day.  
- **Write a 3-sentence post-mortem.** What went well, one tweak, next action. No spirals.  
- **Add a recovery action.** After a rejection, immediately do one positive: send a thank-you, log the lesson, or apply to a better-matched role.

## Design a 3-block day: a routine that protects energy and progress

Mornings have your clearest focus; afternoons are best for light lifts; evenings refuel you for tomorrow.

**Tiny scenario:** 9‚Äì11am deep work (resume tailoring), 2‚Äì3pm light lifts (applications, follow-ups), 6‚Äì7pm growth (course, portfolio, mock interview).

- **Block A ‚Äî Deep work (90‚Äì120 min).** One high-impact task: resume tailoring, portfolio updates, targeted applications.  
- **Block B ‚Äî Light lifts (45‚Äì60 min).** Outreach, tracking, interview scheduling, low-cog tasks.  
- **Block C ‚Äî Growth (30‚Äì60 min).** Practice, learn, or build. Keep receipts of progress (links, notes, artifacts).  
- **Protect the edges.** A starting ritual (timer + beverage) and a closing ritual (log wins + prep tomorrow).  
- **Weekly reset.** Review your tracker, celebrate small wins, choose next week‚Äôs ‚Äúone big rock.‚Äù

## FAQs

### How do I keep a routine without a boss or clock?
Pick three blocks (focus, admin, growth). Schedule them like meetings. Show up even when you don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äîespecially for the first five minutes.

### What if I‚Äôm overwhelmed by choices?
Choose a 2-week theme (e.g., ‚Äúcustomer support roles‚Äù). Build one resume, one portfolio tweak, one outreach script around that theme.

### I feel isolated‚Äîhow can I get accountable?
Find one buddy. Share your weekly plan on Monday; send proof-of-work Friday. Keep it simple: a screenshot or a short note.
