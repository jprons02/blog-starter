## Wondering what the VA actually pays for—and what it doesn’t?

VA health care can be a lifeline—but the rules can feel like alphabet soup. Here’s a plain-English guide to what’s covered, what isn’t, and how to get in the door fast. <IfLocation>In <City/>, <State/>, some steps and clinic options can differ—plan with local requirements in mind.</IfLocation>

## Start here: what to do first

- Gather the basics: your DD214 (or other separation papers), current address, income info (for means testing), and any private insurance.
- Apply once, then use it everywhere: enroll online, by phone, or in person; you’ll be placed into a priority group that affects costs and access.
- After enrollment, pick a primary care team and set up secure messaging so referrals, prescriptions, and labs move quickly.
- If you’re recently separated, served in a combat zone, or have toxic-exposure concerns, flag that during enrollment—it can expand access.
- Keep a one-page “care sheet” with medications, conditions, and service-connected issues to speed up appointments.

## Copays and coverage layers: when VA is free—and when you’ll pay something

Here’s the basic shape of costs and who pays what:

- Many services are no-copay for certain groups (for example, care tied to service-connected conditions, preventive care, and most mental health).
- Copays—when they apply—depend on your priority group, income, and the type of visit (primary care, specialty, inpatient, prescriptions).
- If you have private insurance, VA may bill your plan for non-service-connected care; this typically doesn’t raise your premiums.
- Prescription costs vary by medication tier; ask about 90-day mail delivery and generics to save time and money.
- Travel pay can reimburse eligible veterans for mileage or common carrier costs to approved appointments.
- Scenario: You go to a routine cardiology visit unrelated to service. If you’re in a higher-income priority group, expect a copay; if you’re low-income or the visit relates to a rated condition, it may be $0.

## Not covered (usually): dental, routine eyeglasses, and elective care—plus exceptions

What VA covers is broad, but it isn’t everything:

- Dental care is limited to specific eligibility categories (for example, 100% service-connected, a qualifying dental disability, or within certain post-discharge windows). Others can buy discounted insurance through VADIP.
- Routine eyeglasses and contacts aren’t universal benefits; coverage generally hinges on qualifying clinical needs or specific eligibility groups.
- Cosmetic or experimental procedures aren’t typically covered; “medically necessary” is the lodestar.
- Family members don’t use your VA health care; some may qualify for CHAMPVA or TRICARE depending on your status.
- Emergency and urgent care have special rules (including in-network requirements for community urgent care). Call the dedicated numbers on your VA card before going if you can.
- Scenario: Your tooth cracks on a weekend. If you don’t meet VA dental eligibility, you’ll likely use private dental care or VADIP; VA urgent care won’t routinely do definitive dental procedures.

## FAQs

### Do I have to pay if I have Medicare or private insurance?
Often no for care tied to service-connected conditions; otherwise, copays can apply based on your priority group. VA may bill your private plan for non-service-connected care.

### Can my family use my VA health care?
Generally no. Spouses/dependents may qualify for CHAMPVA or TRICARE depending on your disability rating and status.

### Can I use urgent care outside VA?
If enrolled and eligible, you can use in-network community urgent care for minor issues; keep your VA ID handy and follow program rules about visit limits and notifications.
