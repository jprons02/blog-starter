## Food Assistance for Single Parents

Several programs exist to help cover the cost of groceries:

- **SNAP** (Food Stamps): Monthly funds for groceries on an EBT card  
- **WIC**: For pregnant women and kids under 5, includes formula, milk, and more  
- **School Meal Programs**: Free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch  

You can often apply for these programs together through your state benefits portal.

## Housing Help

Rent and housing can take up the majority of your income â€” these programs can help:

1. **Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers**: Helps cover a portion of rent  
2. **Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA)**: For those at risk of eviction  
3. **Public Housing**: Available in many cities for very low-income families  

Search your local public housing agency (PHA) or housing authority website.

## Childcare Assistance

Paying for childcare is often impossible on a single income. These programs may help:

- **CCDF (Child Care and Development Fund)**: Helps with daycare costs  
- **Head Start / Early Head Start**: Free early education and daycare programs  
- **State programs**: Many states offer subsidized child care for working parents  

Some programs require proof of employment or school enrollment.

## Other Support to Know About

- **TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)**: Cash assistance + job help  
- **Medicaid**: Free or low-cost healthcare for you and your kids  
- **Pell Grants**: Help single parents go back to school or finish college  
- **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)**: A major tax refund boost for working parents
