## Start Here: A Plain-English Plan to Decide Between SSI and SSDI

- Ask two questions first: **Do I have enough recent work history?** and **Is my income/resources currently very limited?**  
  - Enough work credits + long-term medical limits ‚Üí start with **SSDI**.  
  - Very limited income/resources (even with little/no work history) ‚Üí look at **SSI**.  
  - Many people **apply for both** to see which one lands.
- Gather what you‚Äôll need up front: recent medical records, medication list, doctor contacts, past employers, and a simple timeline of symptoms and limits.
- Create a **my Social Security** account to check work credits and prep forms.  
- Apply: SSDI often starts online; SSI typically starts with your local office‚Äîask for a **protective filing date** when you first make contact.
- If denied, don‚Äôt stop‚Äî**appeals are part of the path**, not a failure. Put deadlines on your calendar the day you get a notice.

## Inside SSA‚Äôs Five-Step Decision: What Examiners Check and How to Prepare

_A tiny scenario:_ You were a delivery driver with severe neuropathy. You can‚Äôt lift boxes or stand long. Here‚Äôs how your case is reviewed, and how to strengthen it:

- **Work test (Step 1):** Are you working at a level SSA considers ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù? Keep pay stubs and hours to show any cuts or stoppages.
- **Severity & duration (Step 2):** Medical evidence must show a condition that significantly limits basic work activities and is expected to last **12+ months** (or be terminal). Ask providers to include **functional limits** (how long you can sit/stand, lift, concentrate).
- **Listings (Step 3):** Some conditions meet criteria outright. If you‚Äôre close, ask your doctor to address the specific findings SSA looks for (e.g., exams, imaging, labs).
- **Past work (Step 4):** SSA decides what you actually did on the job, not just the title. Write a clear summary of your **real tasks and physical/mental demands**.
- **Other work (Step 5):** Age, education, and skills matter. If limits leave few realistic jobs, the **medical-vocational rules** can tip the decision your way.
- Preparation moves: keep a **symptom/work diary**, respond quickly to SSA mail, bring a simple **med list** and **treating-source letters** that focus on functional ability (not just diagnoses).

## Working While You Apply or After Approval: Trial Work, SSI Earnings Rules, and Smart Reporting

_A tiny scenario:_ You try 12 hours/week as a cashier to see if you can manage. You‚Äôre worried you‚Äôll lose everything‚Äîhere‚Äôs the guardrail view:

- **SSDI‚Äôs Trial Work Period (TWP):** Lets you **test work for 9 months** (not necessarily consecutive) within a 60-month window while still getting your SSDI check‚Äî**report your earnings** and keep records.
- After TWP, the **Extended Period of Eligibility** can pause/resume checks when earnings go above/below SSA‚Äôs limits; always keep copies of pay stubs and notices.
- **SSI works differently:** Payments **adjust with earnings**‚Äîthey can go down as you earn more, but may not drop to zero if earnings are low enough.
- **Impairment-Related Work Expenses (IRWEs):** Certain out-of-pocket costs tied to working (e.g., specialized transit, assistive devices) can reduce countable earnings.
- **Report early and often:** Call, use approved online tools where available, and document every report (dates, who you spoke with, what you sent).

##FAQs 

### Can I qualify for both SSI and SSDI at the same time?
Yes. Some people get SSDI based on work history and a small SSI payment to top up limited income/resources.

### How long will a decision take?
Timelines vary by case and backlog. Plan for months, not weeks, and track every deadline on appeal notices.

### Do I need a lawyer?
Not required, but experienced representatives can help organize evidence and meet deadlines. Fees are generally contingent and capped.
