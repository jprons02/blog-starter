## Introduction

If youâ€™re disabled and unable to work, you may be eligible for monthly benefits through **SSI** or **SSDI** â€” but whatâ€™s the difference? These two programs are both managed by the **Social Security Administration (SSA)**, and while they sound similar, theyâ€™re meant for different situations. This guide will walk you through the basics in plain language.

## What Is SSI?

**Supplemental Security Income (SSI)** is a needs-based program for people with **limited income and resources** who are:

- Aged 65 or older
- Blind
- Disabled (regardless of age)

You donâ€™t need a work history to qualify for SSI. Itâ€™s designed to help those in poverty, and the monthly benefit can help pay for essentials like food, rent, and medicine.

SSI also automatically qualifies you for **Medicaid** in most states.

## What Is SSDI?

**Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)** is for people who have a qualifying **disability** and have worked long enough to earn **Social Security work credits**. Itâ€™s not income-based â€” instead, itâ€™s tied to your work history.

To qualify, you must:

1. Have a documented medical condition that prevents you from working  
2. Have paid into Social Security through previous jobs  
3. Meet the SSAâ€™s definition of disability

SSDI recipients may qualify for **Medicare** after a 24-month waiting period.

If you're on SSDI and need housing help, [Section 8 Housing](./section-8-housing-explained-how-to-get-help-paying-rent) could apply.

## Key Differences: SSI vs SSDI

- **Eligibility**:  
  - SSI = low income + age/disability  
  - SSDI = work credits + disability  
- **Monthly Benefit**:  
  - SSI = fixed, needs-based  
  - SSDI = based on past earnings  
- **Health Coverage**:  
  - SSI = Medicaid  
  - SSDI = Medicare (after 2 years)  
- **Application Process**: Both go through the SSA but use different forms internally

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can apply for both SSI and SSDI at the same time â€” called a **concurrent claim**. If youâ€™re not sure which one you qualify for, start the application and let SSA determine that for you.

## How to Apply

1. **Gather medical and income records**
2. **Apply online at SSA.gov** or visit your local Social Security office
3. **Expect a wait** â€” initial decisions can take several months
4. **Consider legal help** if denied â€” appeals are common, and disability advocates can help
