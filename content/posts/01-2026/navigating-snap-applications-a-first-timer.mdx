## Start here: what to do first

The first step in the SNAP application process is gathering the necessary documentation. This step often trips up applicants, but being prepared can make all the difference. Here's what you need to do:

- **Gather Income Documents**: Collect recent pay stubs, tax returns, or other income proofs. This helps verify your financial situation.
- **Identify Household Members**: List everyone living in your household, as this affects your benefit amount.
- **Prepare Housing and Utility Bills**: These documents are needed to calculate your expense-related deductions.

## Income Verification: What Counts and What Doesn’t

Understanding what income you need to report can be confusing. A common mistake is either over-reporting or under-reporting income, which can affect eligibility.

Imagine you're a single parent working part-time. You might think only your paychecks count, but other sources matter too:

- **Countable Income**: Wages, unemployment benefits, and Social Security.
- **Non-Countable Income**: Some scholarships and disaster assistance may not count.
- **Verification**: Be prepared to show proof for all income sources.

## Navigating the Interview: What to Expect

The SNAP interview can be intimidating, but knowing what to expect helps ease the process. This interview confirms your application details and is a standard part of the approval process.

Consider your interview as a conversation to clarify your application. Here’s what typically happens:

- **Purpose**: Verifies the information you provided.
- **Format**: Can be conducted over the phone or in-person.
- **Preparation**: Have your documents ready and be honest about your situation.

## Recertification: Keeping Your Benefits

Recertification is essential to continue receiving SNAP benefits, and it's a step that often gets overlooked. Missing this can result in a lapse of benefits.

Imagine you're six months into receiving SNAP benefits. You’ll need to recertify to keep them:

- **Notification**: You’ll receive a reminder when it’s time to recertify.
- **Required Documents**: Similar to initial application, keep your income and expense documents updated.
- **Timeliness**: Submit your recertification before the deadline to avoid interruption.
