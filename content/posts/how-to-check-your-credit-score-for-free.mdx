## Start here: three safe ways to see your score today
- **Your bank or card app:** Many card issuers and credit unions show a free FICO¬Æ or VantageScore¬Æ in-app with monthly updates‚Äîno extra sign-ups.
- **Nonprofit counselors:** HUD-approved housing or NFCC-affiliated credit counselors can provide scores and coaching at low/no cost.
- **Credit bureau accounts:** Creating an account with a bureau can show score info and alerts; enable two-factor authentication and use unique passwords.
- **Keep a simple log:** Record the model (FICO or Vantage), version number, bureau, and date so you can compare apples to apples over time.
- **Tiny scenario:** You see a VantageScore 3.0 from your card app and a FICO 8 from your bank; the numbers differ, but both trends should generally move together.

## FICO vs. VantageScore: why the number changes across apps
Small differences in data and math create different outputs‚Äîeven on the same day.
- **Different models, same goal:** Both estimate risk but weigh factors differently (payment history, utilization, age of credit, inquiries, and mix).
- **Version shuffle:** Lenders and apps use different versions (e.g., FICO 8/9/10, Vantage 3.0/4.0); scoring cutoffs can vary by version.
- **Bureau inputs:** Each bureau (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) might have slightly different account data; one late post can shift one score but not others.
- **Mortgage exception:** Mortgage lenders often use older FICO versions; expect a mismatch with the number you see in consumer apps.
- **What to track:** Focus on trends (three-month arcs), not single-day jumps; verify big swings by pulling your **credit reports** and checking for errors.

## Spot the traps: ‚Äúfree trials,‚Äù fake sites, and habits that backfire
- **The only official free report site** is the one authorized by law; bookmark it and type it directly‚Äîavoid search-ad look-alikes.
- **Free trial bait:** Trials can convert to paid monitoring; set a cancellation reminder or skip trials if you just need your score/report.
- **Phishing alarms:** Typos in URLs, pop-ups, and requests for extra data (full PINs, full card numbers) are red flags‚Äîback out immediately.
- **Hard vs. soft checks:** Checking your own score/report is a **soft** inquiry and doesn‚Äôt hurt your score; applying for credit triggers **hard** pulls.
- **Security basics:** Turn on account alerts, freeze your credit if you‚Äôre not applying soon, and use a password manager for bureau and bank logins.
- **Tiny scenario:** A ‚Äúfree score‚Äù site asks for a card ‚Äújust to verify identity.‚Äù You pass‚Äîthen use your bank‚Äôs app and a nonprofit counselor instead.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<IfLocation>
  <h2>FAQs for <City/>, <State/></h2>
  <ResourceLink name="creditScore" field="faqs" />
</IfLocation>

<IfNoLocation>
## FAQs 

### Will checking my own score hurt my credit?
No. Viewing your own score or reports is a **soft** inquiry and doesn‚Äôt affect your score. Applications for new credit are **hard** inquiries.

### Why is my score different across apps?
Different scoring models, versions, and bureaus explain the mismatch. Track the model/version and compare trends, not single numbers.

### Do I need to pay to see my score?
Often no. Many banks and card issuers provide scores for free. If a site asks for a credit card for a ‚Äúfree trial,‚Äù read the terms carefully or use no-cost options instead.

### Should I freeze my credit?
If you‚Äôre not applying soon, a freeze can block new accounts opened in your name. You can lift it temporarily when you need to apply.
