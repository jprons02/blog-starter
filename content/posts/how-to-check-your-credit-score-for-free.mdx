## Your Credit Score vs. Credit Report

- **Your credit score** is a number between 300‚Äì850 that reflects how risky you are to lenders.  
- **Your credit report** is a detailed history of your loans, payments, and accounts.

You‚Äôll usually want to check both ‚Äî the score gives you a snapshot, and the report shows what‚Äôs affecting it.

## How to Check Your Credit Report for Free

You can get your **full credit report from all three bureaus** (Equifax, TransUnion, Experian) for free at:

üëâ [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com)

This is the **only official site** backed by the federal government. You can request all three reports at once or space them out.

> üí° Tip: As of 2023, reports are free **weekly**, not just once a year.

## How to Check Your Credit Score for Free

Your score isn‚Äôt always included with your report, but you can get it free from:

- **Credit card companies** (Chase, Capital One, Discover, etc.)  
- **Bank apps** (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc.)  
- **Free credit tools** like Credit Karma or Credit Sesame

These sources usually show a **VantageScore** or **FICO Score**, depending on the provider.

## Watch Out for Scams and Tricks

Avoid these common traps:

- Sites that ask for a credit card to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù your score  
- Free trials that turn into paid subscriptions  
- Fake clones of AnnualCreditReport.com

Always check the URL and never share sensitive info unless you're on a trusted site.

## Why This Matters

- Many people discover **identity theft** or errors only after checking their report  
- You‚Äôll need your score to qualify for housing, loans, or credit cards  
- Regular checks help you track progress if you're rebuilding credit
