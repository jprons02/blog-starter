## Introduction

Homeownership is part of the American dream â€” and for veterans, itâ€™s also a benefit youâ€™ve earned. The **VA offers housing assistance programs** that can help you buy your first home, refinance for lower rates, or even avoid foreclosure during tough times.

## What Is VA Housing Assistance?

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides:

- **VA-backed home loans** (with no down payment)
- **VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loans (IRRRL)**
- **Mortgage forbearance or repayment plans** if youâ€™re behind
- **Foreclosure prevention counselors**

You donâ€™t need perfect credit or a large savings account â€” just a valid **Certificate of Eligibility (COE)** and stable income.

## Who Qualifies?

You may qualify if you:

- Served **90+ days during wartime** or **181+ during peacetime**
- Are a **National Guard or Reserve** member with 6+ years
- Are a **spouse of a veteran who died in service or from service-connected causes**

## How to Apply

1. Apply for your **Certificate of Eligibility (COE)** online or through your lender
2. Choose a **VA-approved lender**
3. Complete a loan application (VA loans follow lender underwriting but with VA backing)
4. Ask about **VA loan foreclosure protections** if you're struggling

> ðŸ’¡ Already have a VA loan? You might qualify for a streamlined refinance (IRRRL) â€” no appraisal or income check needed.
