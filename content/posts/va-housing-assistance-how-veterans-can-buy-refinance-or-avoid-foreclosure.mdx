## Start here: what to do first

- **Confirm eligibility & get your COE.** Ask a lender to pull your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) or request it yourself. It shows your entitlement and funding-fee status.  
- **Decide your goal.** Buying? Lowering your rate? Tapping equity? Catching up on payments? Your goal determines which VA option fits.  
- **Talk to the servicer early if you‚Äôre behind.** Ask for a **home retention** review (repayment plan, deferment/partial claim, modification). The sooner you call, the more doors stay open.  
- **Know the big levers:** VA purchase loan, **IRRRL** (streamline refi), **cash-out refi**, **assumption** (buyer takes over a VA loan), and loss-mitigation if you‚Äôre at risk.  
- **Document everything.** Keep a dated call log, income proof, hardship letter (1 page), and a realistic budget you can defend.

## Assumable VA loans: a backdoor to lower rates for buyers‚Äîand a strategy for sellers

A lesser-known feature of many VA loans is **assumability**‚Äîa qualified buyer can take over the existing loan, keeping its rate and remaining term.

- **Why buyers care:** In a high-rate market, assuming a 2‚Äì4% VA loan can slash monthly costs without waiting for rates to fall.  
- **Why sellers care:** Marketing ‚Äúassumable VA loan‚Äù can widen your buyer pool. If the buyer is **VA-eligible**, you can often **restore your entitlement** after closing (ask your servicer about full restoration).  
- **Cash gap reality:** The buyer must cover the difference between your loan balance and the sale price (cash or secondary financing).  
- **Gatekeepers:** Assumptions require servicer approval and a small VA funding fee (generally **0.5%** on assumptions).  
- **Example:** A veteran selling a home with a $260k balance at 3.0% to a $340k buyer‚Äîbuyer needs ~$80k to bridge equity (cash or second lien), but keeps the 3.0% rate.  
- **Pro move:** If you‚Äôre selling, screen for VA-eligible buyers to preserve your entitlement. If you‚Äôre buying, ask listing agents explicitly whether the loan is **assumable** and which servicer handles it.

## Behind on payments? How VA loss-mitigation actually works (and what to ask for)

If you‚Äôve missed payments, VA wants servicers to evaluate **home-retention first**‚Äîdon‚Äôt wait for a notice to act.

- **Your first call:** Ask for the **home retention team**. Say you want a **complete loss-mitigation review** and request a written list of required docs.  
- **What they may offer:**  
  - **Repayment plan** (spread arrears over several months).  
  - **Forbearance** (temporary pause/partial payments).  
  - **Loan modification** (roll arrears into the balance and adjust rate/term).  
  - **Partial claim/advanced assistance** (where applicable under current VA guidance).  
- **If keeping the home isn‚Äôt feasible:** Ask about **assumption by a qualified buyer**, **short sale**, or **deed-in-lieu** to avoid a full foreclosure mark.  
- **Time matters:** Opening mail, responding to document requests within days, and keeping a call log can be the difference between a workout and a sale date.  
- **Escalation script:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm requesting a single point of contact and status on my complete package. Please confirm in writing which options are being reviewed and by what date.‚Äù

## FAQs

### How do I know if my loan is assumable?
Most government-backed loans (including many VA loans) can be assumed with servicer approval. Ask your servicer directly and request their assumption checklist.

### Can I use a VA loan more than once?
Yes. Entitlement can be restored after the prior VA loan is paid off‚Äîor when another VA-eligible buyer assumes your loan and substitutes their entitlement.

### What‚Äôs the quickest way to lower my payment if rates dropped?
Ask about **IRRRL** (the VA streamline refi). It‚Äôs designed to reduce rate/payment with minimal documentation when you already have a VA loan.
