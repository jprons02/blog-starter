## When bills pile up and panic hits, here’s a calm, step-by-step path to real help.

Losing sleep over rent, utilities, or a sudden crisis doesn’t mean you’re out of options. This guide shows fast, practical moves that can get support on the phone—and money or housing—when it matters most.

## Quick wins you can try today

- Write a one-page “crisis sheet” (name, DOB, last 4 SSN, address, landlord name/phone, employer, dependents, current income, what changed). Keep it open while calling.
- Call with a clear ask: “I’m a veteran in financial crisis. I need [rent/utility] help this week. What program can move fastest?”
- If you can’t get through, call early (right at open) and again after lunch; many lines triage midday.
- Log every attempt (date/time, number, whom you spoke with, next step). That paper trail helps with escalations and extensions.
- Ask every screener: “If I don’t qualify here, who should I call next?” Gatekeepers often know the fastest back-up.

## The first 10 minutes: who to call and what to say

A focused script and the right numbers can cut hours of hold time.

**Tiny scenario:** You were just served a pay-or-quit notice. You’ve got two days. You open your notes and call in this order:

- **988, Press 1 (Veterans Crisis Line)** if you feel unsafe or overwhelmed. You can ask for safety planning and a warm handoff to local supports.
- **Homeless Veterans line (877-4AID-VET)** for immediate housing triage and rapid problem-solving if you’re at risk of losing your place.
- **County social services** for same-week rent/utility relief or motel vouchers; ask for “emergency diversion” or “eviction prevention” funds.
- **Your landlord** after you’ve made the first call—offer a simple plan (“I’m working with agencies; expect a confirmation number by ___; can we pause fees 7 days?”).
- **Keep the script short:** who you are, what changed (job loss, medical bill), what you need (exact dollar or deadline), and what you’ve already tried.

## Housing tonight vs. long-term: how HUD-VASH fits in

HUD-VASH pairs a housing voucher with VA case management; it’s the long game while you solve tonight.

**Tiny scenario:** You’re couch-surfing after a discharge. A VA case manager screens you for eligibility and starts voucher paperwork while connecting you to short-term options.

- **Short-term moves:** ask about motel vouchers, emergency shelter with “veteran preference,” and rapid-resolution funds to keep you where you are a few weeks longer.
- **Medium-term:** housing search help (landlord lists that accept vouchers, unit inspections, deposit assistance).
- **Long-term:** ongoing case management (benefits enrollment, mental health care, documents), which keeps housing stable after you move in.
- **If you’re not enrolled in VA health care:** you can still ask for homeless program screening—eligibility is broader than many think.
- **If you moved recently:** tell them your last duty station or VA system—coordination across regions is possible.

<IfNoLocation>

### Can I use the Veterans Crisis Line if I’m not enrolled in VA care?
Yes. You don’t need to be enrolled to call, text, or chat. Ask for a “warm handoff” to local supports after your immediate crisis is addressed.

### What if I need emergency housing tonight?
Tell screeners you have an eviction notice or you’re sleeping in your car. Ask specifically about “diversion,” “prevention,” or motel vouchers while longer-term help starts.

### Are there fast cash options for urgent bills?
Ask about military relief societies (service-branch nonprofits) and local veteran funds. Many can issue same- or next-day assistance once they verify need.
