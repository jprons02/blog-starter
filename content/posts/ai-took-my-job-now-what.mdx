## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence isnâ€™t some future threat. Itâ€™s here â€” and itâ€™s already taking jobs.

From self-checkout kiosks to automated copywriting, millions of jobs are being reshaped or replaced by algorithms, robots, and generative AI tools. While some professions will adapt or evolve, others may vanish entirely.

So what happens if your job is next?

## The 3 Main Types of Automation Taking Over Work

AI isnâ€™t just one thing. The job disruption weâ€™re seeing comes from multiple directions â€” and affects different industries in different ways.

### 1. **Physical Automation** (Robots & Machines)

These replace **manual or repetitive physical labor**, often in:

- **Warehouses** (e.g., Amazon robots)
- **Fast food** (e.g., burger-flipping machines)
- **Retail & grocery** (e.g., self-checkout systems)
- **Transportation** (e.g., self-driving delivery vans, trucking pilots)

If your job involves **doing the same motion again and again**, itâ€™s likely a target.

### 2. **Rule-Based Automation** (Traditional Software)

This replaces **routine office work** like:

- **Data entry**
- **Bookkeeping**
- **Claims processing**
- **Basic customer support**

Software bots can now click buttons, fill forms, and move files 24/7 â€” often faster and cheaper than humans.

### 3. **Cognitive Automation** (AI & Machine Learning)

This is the newest and fastest-growing threat â€” and it's coming for knowledge workers.

Generative AI (like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and others) is disrupting:

- **Writing & journalism**
- **Marketing & content creation**
- **Paralegal and research roles**
- **Basic coding and web development**

Tools like these don't just support workers â€” in many cases, they replace entire entry-level roles.

> ðŸ’¡ Even if youâ€™re skilled, if your job is mostly digital, predictable, or repetitive â€” AI can probably do it.

## What Happens If You're Displaced?

If you've already been laid off or had your hours cut due to automation, youâ€™re not alone. And while the system isnâ€™t perfect, there **are some basic safety nets** worth knowing about:

- **SNAP** can help cover groceries if your income drops

- **LIHEAP** can keep the power on if you're behind on utility bills  
  [See our guide](./how-to-get-help-with-utility-bills-liheap-and-other-resources)

These programs werenâ€™t designed for an AI-driven economy â€” but for now, theyâ€™re all we have.

## What You Can Do Next

1. **Track where your industry is headed** â€” Is AI actively being tested where you work?
2. **Reskill proactively** â€” Look into areas that AI still struggles with: emotional labor, complex coordination, trades, or highly creative strategy
3. **Apply for benefits early** â€” Itâ€™s easier to stay afloat than to recover from total collapse

> ðŸ§  **Tip:** The biggest danger isn't just losing your job â€” it's being unprepared when it happens.
