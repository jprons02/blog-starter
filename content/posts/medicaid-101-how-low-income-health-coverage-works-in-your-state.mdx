## Health coverage shouldn’t be a mystery when money’s tight—here’s how Medicaid really works where you live.

Medicaid can be the difference between skipping care and getting it covered. This quick guide walks you through what to check first, what varies by state, and how to avoid common pitfalls during renewals.

## Start here: what to do first

- Check your household size and monthly income against your state’s Medicaid/CHIP thresholds.
- Make sure your mailing address, phone, and email are current with your state agency.
- Gather basics now: ID, Social Security numbers (if available), pay stubs, rent, and child care/medical expense records.
- If you’re over income, look into CHIP for kids or Marketplace savings before you assume you’re out.
- Keep a simple “coverage file”: dates, who you spoke with, confirmation/case numbers, and any uploads you submit.

## State rules, different outcomes: why your neighbor qualifies and you don’t

Some states expanded Medicaid to more adults; others didn’t. Even among expansions, details differ.

- Income limits, asset rules (for certain groups), and disability pathways vary by state.
- Pregnancy, postpartum, and children’s coverage often have higher income limits than adult coverage.
- Recent movers: residency proof can be the hang-up—prep a lease, utility, or official mail.
- Tribal members, former foster youth, and people leaving incarceration may have special pathways.
- If denied, you can appeal—deadlines are short. Read the notice and act quickly.

## The renewal crunch: how to keep coverage during “unwinding” and beyond

Millions are being rechecked after pandemic protections ended. Many losses are paperwork—fixable with a plan.

- Open every envelope/text/email from your state agency; unanswered mail is the #1 coverage killer.
- Auto-renew doesn’t always catch everyone; if you get a form, complete it fully and on time.
- If you’re dropped but still eligible, you can request a reconsideration with proof—don’t delay.
- Kids can stay eligible even if a parent loses coverage; check each person’s status separately.
- If ultimately ineligible, compare low-cost Marketplace plans within 60 days of losing Medicaid.

## Extra Medicaid Benefits

Depending on your state, Medicaid may also include:

- **Dental care**  
- **Vision services**  
- **Transportation** to appointments  
- **Behavioral health** and substance use treatment

Some states offer **Medicaid Managed Care**, where you choose a specific provider network.

## FAQs

### How do I know if my state expanded Medicaid?
Expansion status changes over time. The fastest route is to check your state Medicaid site or call your local agency and ask about adult expansion.

### What if I moved states recently?
Apply in your new state and be ready to verify residency. You can’t be enrolled in two states at once, so close out your old case if needed.

### I missed a renewal deadline—am I out of luck?
Not necessarily. Many states allow you to submit information shortly after closure to reinstate coverage without a full new application.
