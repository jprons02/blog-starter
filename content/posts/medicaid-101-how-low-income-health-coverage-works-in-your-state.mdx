## Introduction

Healthcare is expensive â€” but if your income is low or youâ€™re facing hardship, **Medicaid** may provide the coverage you need. Itâ€™s a **state-run** program with **federal funding**, which means every state offers it â€” but the rules can vary a lot. This guide covers how Medicaid works, whoâ€™s eligible, and how to apply in your state.

## What Is Medicaid?

Medicaid is a **public health insurance program** for people with low incomes. It covers essential medical services, including:

- Doctor visits
- Hospital stays
- Mental health care
- Prescriptions
- Prenatal care and childbirth
- Long-term care (in some cases)

In most states, coverage is **free**, or has very low co-pays.

## Who Qualifies for Medicaid?

Eligibility is based on your **income, household size, and specific needs**. You may qualify if you are:

1. Pregnant or recently gave birth  
2. A child under 19  
3. A parent or guardian of a minor  
4. A person with a disability  
5. A senior 65+  
6. A low-income adult (in Medicaid expansion states)

Income limits vary â€” for example, a single adult earning under ~$20,000/year may qualify in many states.

## How to Apply for Medicaid

The process is state-specific, but generally:

1. **Go to your stateâ€™s Medicaid website** or healthcare marketplace  
2. **Submit an application** online, by phone, or in person  
3. **Provide income and residency documentation**  
4. **Wait for a decision** â€” approval can take days to weeks  
5. **Use your benefits** with providers who accept Medicaid

If youâ€™re eligible, youâ€™ll receive a Medicaid card in the mail.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Even if you were denied in the past, try again â€” eligibility rules have changed in many states since the pandemic.

## Extra Medicaid Benefits

Depending on your state, Medicaid may also include:

- **Dental care**
- **Vision services**
- **Transportation to appointments**
- **Behavioral health and substance abuse treatment**

Some states offer **Medicaid Managed Care**, where you choose a specific provider network.
