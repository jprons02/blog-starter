## Start here: what to do first
- **Find your state portal** and start the application‚Äîeven if a few documents are missing. Submitting now locks your filing date.
- **Prep your proof packet:** photo ID, household list, income for all adults, rent/mortgage and utilities, childcare/medical costs (if applicable).
- **Expect a brief interview** (often by phone). Keep your phone on, set up voicemail, and call back promptly if you miss them.
- **Ask about expedited service** if money and food are critically short right now.
- **Track everything:** save your confirmation number, upload receipts as clear PDFs/photos, and keep a simple contact log.

## Who ‚Äúcounts‚Äù in your household‚Äîand why it changes your benefit
Household isn‚Äôt just who shares the address; it‚Äôs who buys and prepares food together. Getting this wrong is a common reason for delays or incorrect amounts.
- **Roommates vs. households:** roommates with separate food budgets are often separate households.
- **Shared custody of kids:** if a child splits time, list where they ‚Äúusually‚Äù eat and sleep; be ready to explain the schedule.
- **Adult children or relatives:** if they share groceries or income, they may be part of your SNAP household; if not, they might not be.
- **Temporary guests:** short stays don‚Äôt necessarily change your household, but long or recurring stays can‚Äînote dates and purpose.
- **Tip:** draft a one-paragraph ‚Äúhousehold statement‚Äù that explains who eats together and why.

## From application to EBT: what actually moves your case forward
Understanding the workflow helps you avoid stalls and speed approvals.
- **Verification layers:** workers must confirm identity, household, income, and certain expenses‚Äîclear, labeled uploads save time.
- **Income that changed:** add a short note (hours cut, new job, seasonal work) with recent pay stubs so your current situation is clear.
- **Deductions matter:** rent, utilities, dependent care, and medical costs for elderly/disabled members can raise your monthly amount‚Äîdocument them.
- **Missed interview?** Call your local office right away to reschedule; note date/time of your call in your log.
- **After approval:** watch for a mailed EBT card, set a PIN, and read your notice for how and when to report changes.
