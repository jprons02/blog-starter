## Start here: what to do first

- File **immediately** in the state where you worked; your ‚Äúbenefit week‚Äù often starts the day you apply.  
- Create a simple doc kit: photo ID, last employer‚Äôs name and address, last day worked, reason for separation, pay stubs/W-2, and direct deposit info.  
- Open a claims account and set alerts (email/SMS) so you don‚Äôt miss identity verification or requests for documents.  
- Learn the rhythm: most states require **weekly or biweekly certification** to keep payments moving. Put it on your calendar now.  
- Keep a job-search log (dates, employers, outcomes). Many states ask for it during eligibility checks.  
- If your hours were cut (not zero), check if **partial benefits** apply.

## State rules, different outcomes: why weekly certifications trip people up

_A tiny scenario:_ You get approved, then payments stop. Nothing changed‚Äîexcept you missed **one** weekly certification while traveling for an interview.

- Many states stop paying if you skip a weekly/biweekly claim‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre still eligible.  
- ‚ÄúReopen‚Äù vs ‚Äúnew‚Äù claim is often confused; filing a new claim by mistake can delay payment.  
- Short-term work may require you to **report earnings for the week you worked**, even if paid later.  
- Some states ask work-search details weekly; incomplete entries cause holds.  
- Pro move: set a repeating reminder and pre-fill your job-search notes so certification takes under five minutes.

## The overpayment trap: how to avoid letters‚Äîand what to do if one shows up

_A tiny scenario:_ A temp assignment bumps your earnings for two weeks; you report late and get an **overpayment** letter months later.

- Overpayment ‚â† fraud by default; it can stem from timing or paperwork errors.  
- Act fast: states have short windows to **appeal** or **request a waiver** when the error wasn‚Äôt your fault and repayment is a hardship.  
- Keep pay stubs, job offers, and certification confirmations‚Äîthese support appeals and waivers.  
- If you‚Äôre back at work, ask about **offset limits** so repayment doesn‚Äôt zero out your budget.  
- Call the agency and document every conversation (date, name, summary); follow with a short confirmation note in the portal if available.

## FAQs 

### How fast will I get my first payment?
Timelines vary. Many states pay after identity checks and the first weekly certification. Expect a gap of at least one to three weeks.

### Can I work part-time and still collect?
Often yes. You must report any earnings for the week worked; your payment may be reduced based on state formulas.

### What if my employer contests my claim?
Respond to all questionnaires quickly. Provide dates, schedules, write-ups, and your separation explanation in clear, factual language.
