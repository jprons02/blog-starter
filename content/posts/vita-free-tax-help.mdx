## Start here: what to do first

- Find a nearby VITA/TCE site and check hours, appointment policy, and drop-off options. Use the official IRS locator to confirm details and avoid scams: <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find Free Tax Prep</a>.
- Make a one-page ‚Äútax kit‚Äù: photo ID; SSN/ITIN letters; last year‚Äôs return; W-2/1099s; 1098-T/E; 1095-A if you had Marketplace coverage; childcare totals; routing/account numbers.
- Write your ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù note (job switch, unemployment, new kid, moved states). Volunteers use this to spot credits you might miss.
- If you‚Äôre married filing jointly, both spouses should come (or follow site rules for e-signature). Bring IDs for both.
- Expect a quality review: a second volunteer checks the return before it‚Äôs filed‚Äîthis is normal and protects your refund.

## Who qualifies‚Äîincome caps, ITIN filers, and the exceptions that surprise people

**Tiny scenario:** You make ~$40k, drive for gigs on weekends, and your spouse has an ITIN. You assume VITA can‚Äôt handle Schedule C or ITINs‚Äîturns out many sites can.

- VITA focuses on low-to-moderate income taxpayers, people with disabilities, and limited English speakers; many sites set income caps in the mid-$60k range, but it varies by site (check the IRS overview: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who VITA/TCE serves</a>).
- ITIN filers: some locations can help apply for or renew ITINs and prepare your return in one stop; ask specifically about ITIN services.
- Self-employed: many VITA sites prepare basic Schedule C (no depreciation/inventory). Bring mileage and expense totals by category.
- Seniors 60+: TCE (often at AARP Tax-Aide sites) focuses on retirement and pension questions.
- Military families: ask about MilTax or local VITA sites on base‚Äîspecial rules may boost your refund.

## Beat the rush: appointment tactics and the form that saves 30 minutes

**Tiny scenario:** You tried to walk in on April 13 and got turned away. Next time you book early, fill the intake form at home, and you‚Äôre in and out in under an hour.

- Peak times are Saturdays and the two weeks before the deadline; best bets are weekday mornings and right after a site opens.
- If the phone line is jammed, try in-person sign-up hours or a library site that books slots in batches.
- Fill out the official intake form (Form 13614-C) at home so your volunteer can dive straight into the return: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13614c.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRS Form 13614-C (fillable)</a>.
- Bring proof of health coverage or your Form 1095-A if you used the Marketplace; volunteers must verify this to avoid IRS letters.
- Keep a checklist of what‚Äôs missing; most sites allow quick document drop-offs to finish your file without losing your spot.
