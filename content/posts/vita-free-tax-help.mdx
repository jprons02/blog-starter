## Introduction

Tax season can be stressful â€” especially if youâ€™re worried about making mistakes or canâ€™t afford a tax preparer. But thereâ€™s good news: you may be able to get **free, IRS-certified help** through the **Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)** program.

VITA offers reliable, in-person or virtual tax help for those who qualify â€” no hidden fees, no scams, just real support.

## What Is the VITA Program?

VITA stands for **Volunteer Income Tax Assistance**, a program run by the IRS to help people prepare and file basic tax returns for free.

Trained and certified volunteers assist with:

- Federal and state tax returns
- Claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
- Filing for the Child Tax Credit (CTC)
- E-filing for faster refunds
- Answering questions about deductions and credits

Services are available in English and Spanish at most locations.

## Who Qualifies for Free Tax Help?

VITA services are available to:

- People who generally make **$64,000 or less per year**
- **Persons with disabilities**
- **Limited English-speaking taxpayers**
- **Older adults** (through TCE, a related program for seniors)

Even if you worked part-time or only had unemployment income, you may still qualify â€” and itâ€™s worth it to file because of refundable credits.

## How to Find a VITA Location

Hereâ€™s how to get free tax help:

1. **Use the IRS VITA locator tool**: [irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep](https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/)
2. Or call **1-800-906-9887** to find a site near you
3. **Schedule an appointment** or check walk-in hours
4. **Bring documents**: ID, Social Security cards, W-2s, 1099s, and last yearâ€™s return

Some locations offer drop-off service or virtual appointments depending on staffing.

## Tips for Tax Season

- **File early**: Get your refund faster and avoid last-minute issues
- **Ask about credits**: Many people miss out on EITC or CTC simply because they donâ€™t know they qualify
- **Bring all income documents**: Even small side jobs or gig work count

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** VITA volunteers are trained by the IRS every year â€” theyâ€™re more reliable than pop-up tax chains or paid preparers who may charge hidden fees.
