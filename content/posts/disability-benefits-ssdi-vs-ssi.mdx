## Introduction

If you or a loved one are living with a disability, you may qualify for monthly financial support from the federal government — but many people don’t understand the difference between **SSDI** and **SSI**.

These two programs offer disability benefits, but they have very different eligibility rules. Knowing which one applies to your situation can help you get the support you need faster.

## What’s the Difference Between SSDI and SSI?

Both SSDI and SSI are run by the **Social Security Administration (SSA)**, but they serve different people:

**SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance):**
- For disabled workers who have a qualifying work history
- Based on the number of work credits and disability status
- Monthly benefit varies depending on your past income

**SSI (Supplemental Security Income):**
- For low-income individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled
- Based on financial need (income and assets)
- Maximum monthly benefit for an individual in 2025 is $943

You can't receive both full SSDI and full SSI at the same time, but some people do qualify for partial benefits from each.

## Who Qualifies for SSDI?

To get SSDI, you must:

1. Have a **disability expected to last at least one year or result in death**
2. Have **earned enough work credits** (based on your age and job history)
3. Be **unable to perform substantial gainful work**

SSDI is an insurance program — you "pay into it" by working and paying Social Security taxes.

## Who Qualifies for SSI?

To get SSI, you must:

1. Be **age 65 or older**, **blind**, or **disabled**
2. Have **very limited income and resources**
3. Be a **U.S. citizen or qualified immigrant**

SSI is a need-based program and does not require a work history.

## How to Apply for Disability Benefits

You can apply for both programs:

1. **Online at SSA.gov**
2. **By calling 1-800-772-1213**
3. **At your local Social Security office**

The application will ask for medical records, income info, work history, and proof of disability. It can take 3–6 months (or longer) to get a decision.

If you’re denied, don’t give up — you can appeal and many applicants win benefits on appeal.

People who qualify for SSI often also qualify for [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/) and [SNAP food assistance](./wic-vs-snap-what-s-the-difference-and-can-you-get-both).

## Tips for Applicants

- **Document everything**: Keep records of doctor visits, test results, and medication
- **Start early**: Apply as soon as you become unable to work — delays can cost you months of payments
- **Get help**: Legal aid or disability advocates can assist you if your claim is denied

> 💡 **Tip:** Many people wrongly assume they can’t qualify because they “haven’t worked enough” — but SSI exists for those with no work history. Don’t self-reject.
