## Two federal programs can keep the lights on while you focus on your health.

SSDI and SSI sound similar, but they serve different people and use different rules. Here‚Äôs a clear, encouraging breakdown so you can figure out which path fits‚Äîand what to do next. <IfLocation>For readers in <City/>, <State/>, Medicaid tie-ins, state supplements, and local office procedures aren‚Äôt identical‚Äîlook for <State/> callouts before you apply.</IfLocation>

## Start here: what to do first
- **Map your likely lane.** If you‚Äôve worked and paid Social Security taxes, you may fit **SSDI**; if your income/resources are very limited, you may fit **SSI**‚Äîsome people apply for both.
- **Write a timeline of your condition.** When symptoms started, treatments tried, flare-ups, and how work tasks became hard or impossible.
- **List your providers and records.** Doctors, clinics, hospitals, therapists, meds, imaging, and any work restrictions a clinician has documented.
- **Document work impact.** Tasks you can‚Äôt do reliably, safely, or consistently; missed days; performance write-ups‚Äîspecifics matter.
- **Prepare for the wait.** Initial decisions often take months; plan for interim help (food, housing, health coverage) while your case moves.

## Why similar diagnoses get different decisions: SSDI work credits vs. SSI financial need
- **Different gates.** SSDI checks your **insured status** (enough recent work credits) and whether your condition prevents substantial work. SSI checks **income and resource limits** plus disability.
- **The recency rule.** For SSDI, credits must be **recent**‚Äîgaps in work can reduce eligibility even if your condition is severe.
- **Household math.** SSI looks at countable income and resources; some support you receive may reduce the payment amount.
- **Mixed outcomes happen.** You can be denied SSDI for insufficient credits yet qualify for SSI based on need‚Äîor qualify for both with different monthly amounts.
- **What to gather.** Proof of past employment and W-2s for SSDI; bank balances, rent, and support details for SSI.

## Inside the decision: the five steps SSA uses (and how to prepare)
- **Step 1: Are you working above the limit?** Earnings over a monthly threshold can count as substantial work; if not, review continues.
- **Step 2: Is your condition ‚Äúsevere‚Äù?** It must significantly limit basic work activities for at least 12 months (or be terminal).
- **Step 3: Does it meet or equal a listed impairment?** If your medical evidence matches specific criteria, you may be approved here.
- **Step 4: Can you do your past work?** SSA looks at your residual functional capacity and compares it to your recent jobs.
- **Step 5: Can you adjust to other work?** Age, education, and skills matter. Be thorough about limitations like pace, attendance, and need for accommodations.
- **Your prep list.** Keep treatment notes organized, ask providers for functional statements, and describe typical ‚Äúbad days‚Äù with concrete examples.

## FAQs

### Can I work at all and still qualify?
Possibly. SSA looks at whether you can perform **substantial** work. Limited part-time earnings below the threshold may still be allowed; discuss details when you apply.

### Should I apply for both SSDI and SSI?
If your work history is short or spotty, or your resources are low, applying for both can prevent gaps‚ÄîSSA will sort out which program(s) you qualify for.

### How long does a decision take?
Initial decisions often take several months. If denied, reconsideration and appeals add time‚Äîkeep medical care and documentation going throughout.

### What if I‚Äôm approved‚Äîdo benefits last forever?
SSA may schedule **continuing disability reviews**. Stay in treatment, report changes, and keep records to avoid interruptions.
