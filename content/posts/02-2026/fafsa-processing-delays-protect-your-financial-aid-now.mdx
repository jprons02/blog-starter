## Start here: what to do first

When you learn of a delay in your FAFSA processing, it's essential to stay proactive. Here's how you can start:

- **Confirm Details:** Make sure all your information on the FAFSA is correct and complete. Missing or incorrect information is a common cause of delays.
- **Check Your Email:** The Department of Education often sends updates regarding your FAFSA status. Keep an eye on your email for any requests for additional information.

## Understanding Verification: A Common Delay Factor

Verification is a process that can delay your FAFSA, but knowing what it is can help you prepare.

Verification is when the Department of Education requires additional documentation to confirm the information on your FAFSA. Picture this scenario: You receive a notice that you need to provide tax transcripts. Here's what you should know:

- **Why It Happens:** About 30% of applicants are selected for verification to ensure accuracy.
- **Documents Needed:** Common requests include tax returns, W-2 forms, and proof of income.
- **Timeframe:** Respond promptly to requests to avoid further delays.
- **Impact:** Delays in verification can postpone your financial aid disbursement.

## The Role of SAR: Ensuring Your FAFSA is Processed Correctly

The Student Aid Report (SAR) is crucial for tracking your FAFSA status.

After submitting your FAFSA, you will receive a SAR summarizing your information. Imagine reading through your SAR and spotting an error. Here's how the SAR helps:

- **What It Includes:** Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and FAFSA status.
- **Why It Matters:** Errors on your SAR can lead to processing delays.
- **Action Steps:** Review your SAR carefully and correct any inaccuracies through FAFSA corrections.
- **Follow-Up:** If you haven't received your SAR within a few weeks, contact the FAFSA helpline.

## Your next steps (one-page plan)

To minimize the impact of FAFSA delays, follow this simple plan:

1. **Review Your FAFSA:** Ensure all information is accurate and complete.
2. **Monitor Communications:** Regularly check for updates from the Department of Education and your school.
3. **Prepare for Verification:** Gather necessary documents ahead of time.
4. **Stay Connected:** Keep in touch with your financial aid office for guidance and support.
5. **Correct Errors Promptly:** Use your SAR to identify and fix any issues quickly.
