## Short-Term Payment Plans: A Quick Fix for Temporary Issues

For those experiencing short-term financial difficulties, the IRS offers a short-term payment plan. Here's what you need to know:

- **Eligibility**: Generally available if you owe less than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties, and interest.
- **Duration**: Allows up to 180 days to pay the full amount.
- **Fees**: No set-up fee, but penalties and interest continue to accrue until the balance is paid.

Imagine you received an unexpected medical bill that temporarily impacts your ability to pay taxes. A short-term payment plan can provide breathing room while you manage both obligations.

- **Apply online**: Easily accessible through the IRS website.
- **No need for extensive paperwork**: Typically requires only basic financial information.
- **Flexibility**: Adjust payments if your financial situation changes.

## Installment Agreements: Spreading Out Your Payments

Installment agreements let you pay off your tax debt over time, making it more manageable for many taxpayers:

- **Longer repayment period**: These plans extend payments up to 72 months.
- **Eligibility**: Suitable if you owe $50,000 or less in combined taxes, penalties, and interest.
- **Setup fee**: A fee applies, but it can be reduced if you agree to automatic withdrawals.

Consider a scenario where you're balancing monthly expenses on a limited income. An installment agreement lets you spread out your tax payments, reducing the immediate financial burden.

- **Set up online or by phone**: Multiple ways to apply, depending on your preference.
- **Avoid collection actions**: Keeps the IRS from taking enforcement actions while you're making payments.
- **Modify if needed**: You can request modifications if your circumstances change.
