## Start here: what to do first

To begin your journey to securing SNAP benefits while working full-time, it's crucial to assess your eligibility based on income and household size:

- **Check Income Limits**: Every state has specific income thresholds for SNAP eligibility. Ensure your household income meets these limits.
- **Evaluate Household Size**: SNAP benefits are calculated based on the number of people in your household. Include all dependents.
- **Gather Documentation**: Collect pay stubs, identification, and any necessary proof of expenses, like rent or childcare, to support your application.

## The Earning Dilemma: Balancing Income and Benefits

Did you know that certain expenses can lower your countable income, making you eligible for SNAP even if you work full-time? Here’s how it works:

Imagine you earn just above the income limit for SNAP, but you also pay for childcare and high medical expenses. These costs can be deducted, lowering your countable income:

- **Childcare Deduction**: If you pay for childcare while working, these expenses can significantly reduce your countable income.
- **Medical Expenses**: For households with elderly or disabled members, unreimbursed medical expenses over $35 can be deducted.
- **Shelter Costs**: High rent or mortgage payments relative to your income can also be considered.

## Navigating Work Requirements: What You Need to Know

While working full-time, you might wonder how work requirements affect your SNAP eligibility. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Work Hours**: Generally, adults without dependents must meet certain work requirements, but full-time work usually satisfies these.
- **Work Exceptions**: If you are unable to work due to health reasons or caregiving responsibilities, you may qualify for an exemption.
- **State Variations**: Some states have additional work-related requirements or waivers based on local conditions.
