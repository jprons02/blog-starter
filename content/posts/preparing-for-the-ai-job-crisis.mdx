## Your next steps (one-page plan)

- **Map your tasks, not your job title.** Break a typical week into tasks: info-gathering, drafting, analysis, decisions, stakeholder work, compliance. Circle what AI can draft versus what you must judge.  
- **Practice human-in-the-loop.** Pair AI with your expertise: you set the goal, constraints, and acceptance criteria; AI proposes drafts; you verify, explain, and decide.  
- **Pick one moat to deepen this month.** Choose **domain depth** (regulations, standards, industry context), **systems thinking** (how parts fit and fail), or **people work** (clients, teams, negotiation).  
- **Ship one portfolio artifact per week.** A brief, explainer, tiny tool, or walkthrough that proves judgment, not just output.  
- **Set a learning rhythm.** 2 hours/week: 45 min concept, 45 min practice, 30 min retro. Repeat for 8 weeks on one stack of skills.

## The Judgment Edge: Turning AI drafts into decisions people trust

AI is great at fluent drafts; organizations pay for correct, defensible choices under constraints‚Äîthat‚Äôs judgment.

**A quick scenario:** An AI drafts a customer-refund email with policy citations. You decide whether to grant an exception based on risk, precedent, and fairness‚Äîand you document why.

- **Mechanism:** Move from *content production* to *criteria design*. Define what ‚Äúgood‚Äù means before you generate.  
- **Add guardrails:** Require sources, uncertainty notes, and a checklist (privacy, compliance, reputational risk) with every AI suggestion.  
- **Traceability matters:** Keep a short decision log linking inputs ‚Üí options ‚Üí final call.  
- **Stakeholder fit:** Translate the same answer for legal, finance, and the customer‚Äîdifferent stakes, same core decision.  
- **Outcome loop:** Review a small sample of past decisions monthly; tighten criteria where errors cluster.

## Translational Skills: From messy business problems to prompts‚Äîand back

The rare skill isn‚Äôt writing clever prompts; it‚Äôs **structuring ambiguity** so AI and humans can act.

**A quick scenario:** A manager asks, ‚ÄúCan we cut onboarding time?‚Äù You extract constraints (compliance steps, role types), define success metrics, and turn that into structured tasks AI can draft, while you run the pilot and measure impact.

- **Problem framing:** Convert vague goals into measurable questions, inputs, and acceptance tests.  
- **Schema building:** Design simple templates‚Äîissue trees, SOP steps, rubrics‚Äîso AI outputs slot into real workflows.  
- **Error budgeting:** Decide which mistakes are tolerable at draft stage and which require human sign-off.  
- **Cross-team fluency:** Speak product, ops, and finance enough to align trade-offs quickly.  
- **Impact habit:** Tie every AI assist to a metric (cycle time, defect rate, NPS) so your work shows up on dashboards.

## FAQs

### Will AI replace most jobs?
Unlikely in the near term. Tasks will shift faster than titles, and roles combining judgment, people skills, and domain depth tend to gain value.

### What should I learn first if I‚Äôm not ‚Äútechnical‚Äù?
Start with workflow mapping, structured writing, and basic data literacy. These make every AI tool more useful and your decisions clearer.

### How do I show employers I can work with AI?
Publish small case studies: your criteria, the AI draft, your review notes, and the final outcome. Hiring managers want to see the process.
