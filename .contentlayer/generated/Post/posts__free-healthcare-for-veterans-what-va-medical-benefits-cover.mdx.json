If you‚Äôre in a higher-income priority group, expect a copay; if you‚Äôre low-income or the visit relates to a rated condition, it may be $0.\n\n<CrossLink href=\"./veteran-crisis-support-free-hotlines-grants-and-emergency-help\">Veteran Crisis Support: Free Hotlines, Grants, and Emergency Help</CrossLink>\n\n## Not covered (usually): dental, routine eyeglasses, and elective care‚Äîplus exceptions\n\nWhat VA covers is broad, but it isn‚Äôt everything:\n\n- Dental care is limited to specific eligibility categories (for example, 100% service-connected, a qualifying dental disability, or within certain post-discharge windows). Others can buy discounted insurance through VADIP.\n- Routine eyeglasses and contacts aren‚Äôt universal benefits; coverage generally hinges on qualifying clinical needs or specific eligibility groups.\n- Cosmetic or experimental procedures aren‚Äôt typically covered; ‚Äúmedically necessary‚Äù is the lodestar.\n- Family members don‚Äôt use your VA health care; some may qualify for CHAMPVA or TRICARE depending on your status.\n- Emergency and urgent care have special rules (including in-network requirements for community urgent care). Call the dedicated numbers on your VA card before going if you can.\n- Scenario: Your tooth cracks on a weekend. If you don‚Äôt meet VA dental eligibility, you‚Äôll likely use private dental care or VADIP; VA urgent care won‚Äôt routinely do definitive dental procedures.\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"mt-3\">üëâ Want a quick read on eligibility? <a href=\"/tools/check-benefits\" className=\"underline\">Check benefits for <City/></a>.</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n> \"I got the help I needed from VA through the Prolonged Exposure Therapy Program.\"\n> ‚Äî Dave Hanson, Phu Cat AFB, Vietnam  \n(*VA News*, [How a Vietnam Veteran overcame PTSD and survivor‚Äôs guilt](https://news.va.gov/62341/air-force-veteran-david-hanson-get-help-need/))\n\n---\n\n<IfLocation>\n  <h2>FAQs for <City/>, <State/></h2>\n  <ResourceLink name=\"va\" field=\"faqs\" />\n</IfLocation>\n\n<IfNoLocation>\n## FAQs\n\n### Do I have to pay if I have Medicare or private insurance?\nOften no for care tied to service-connected conditions; otherwise, copays can apply based on your priority group.
