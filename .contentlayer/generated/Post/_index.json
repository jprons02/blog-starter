Let's delve into the nuances of dark mode vs light mode and explore their respective advantages and disadvantages.\n\n## Pros and Cons of Dark Mode\n\n### Pros\n\n1. Reduced eye strain in low-light environments\n2. Improved battery life on OLED screens\n3. Enhanced readability for users with visual impairments\n\n### Cons\n\n1. Potential reduced readability in bright environments\n2. Color contrast issues for some users\n3. Inconsistent rendering of content\n\n## Pros and Cons of Light Mode\n\n### Pros\n\n1.
