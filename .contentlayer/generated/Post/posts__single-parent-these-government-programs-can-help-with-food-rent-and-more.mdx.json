    "raw": "\n## When money gets tight, you don‚Äôt have to go it alone‚Äîthere are programs designed to help single parents keep food on the table and a roof overhead.\n\nBeing a single parent is a full-time job on top of everything else. This guide maps the fastest ways to check your eligibility and move from ‚Äúwhere do I start?‚Äù to real support‚Äîfood, rent, child care, and more. <IfLocation>In <City/>, <State/>, program names, offices, and timelines can differ‚Äîstart with the local options that match your address.</IfLocation>\n\n<BenefitsCtaBanner focus=\"wic\" copy=\"Get help buying groceries each month with WIC benefits.\" />\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"not-prose my-12 p-4 rounded-xl border-[3px] bg-muted\">\n  <p className=\"mb-2\"><strong>Quick links for <City/>, <State/>:</strong></p>\n  <ul className=\"list-disc ml-5 space-y-1\">\n    <li><ResourceLink name=\"wic\">Apply for WIC</ResourceLink></li>\n    <li><ResourceLink name=\"wic\" field=\"contact\">WIC contacts<IfLocation> ‚Äî <City/>, <State/></IfLocation></ResourceLink></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n## Start here: what to do first\n\n- List your biggest monthly costs (rent, food, child care, utilities). Match each to the program most likely to help (HCV/Section 8, SNAP/WIC, CCDF, LIHEAP).  \n- Call your local agency early in the week and early in the day; ask about waitlists, documents needed, and whether any **priority** categories apply (homelessness risk, DV, disability).  \n- Create a ‚Äúproof‚Äù folder on your phone or cloud (ID, lease, eviction/late notices, pay stubs, benefits letters, child support orders). Keep photos clear and labeled.  \n- Apply even if you‚Äôre unsure‚Äîmany programs screen for you and can route you to alternatives.  \n- Track every step in a simple log (date, person, number, outcome). This helps with appeals, extensions, or priority reviews.\n\n## State rules, different outcomes: why your neighbor qualifies and you don‚Äôt\n\nA lot of confusion comes from the fact that programs are federal but **run locally**. That means income limits, verification rules, and waitlist practices can vary by state, county, or even by housing authority.\n\n**Tiny scenario:** Two single moms with the same income apply for help. One is approved this month; the other waits. The difference? One county uses a points system prioritizing eviction risk; the other uses a time-stamped waitlist that opens once a year.\n\n- SNAP screens monthly income and household size; some states use **broad-based categorical eligibility**, which can raise income thresholds.  \n- Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8) are administered by local PHAs; lists may be closed or open briefly. Some PHAs add points for homelessness, DV, or local residency.  \n- Child care help (CCDF) is state-designed; co-pays and activity requirements (work/school hours) vary widely.  \n- LIHEAP operates seasonally; states differ on crisis definitions, fuel coverage, and required documents.  \n- When rules differ, **ask the agency** which standards they use, whether you meet any priority category, and when to reapply if lists are closed.\n\n<CrossLink href=\"./wic-vs-snap-what-s-the-difference-and-can-you-get-both\">WIC vs SNAP: What's the Difference and Can You Get Both</CrossLink>\n\n## The ‚Äúbenefit cliff‚Äù: how a small raise can shrink your support‚Äîand what to do\n\nBenefits taper as income rises, but sometimes they drop off suddenly‚Äîcreating a **cliff** that can make you feel punished for earning more.\n\n**Tiny scenario:** You accept five extra hours a week. Next month, your child care co-pay jumps, and SNAP drops. Your net gain? Almost nothing.\n\n- Before taking extra hours, use a simple budget ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù: new gross pay vs. likely changes in co-pays and benefits.  \n- Ask caseworkers about **earned income disregards** or transitional help (some programs phase out gradually or offer grace periods).  \n- If your hours are seasonal or irregular, document fluctuations; you may qualify for an average that avoids sudden drops.  \n- Keep receipts for work-related costs (mileage, uniforms, child care during training). These can matter for eligibility or taxes.  \n- File taxes and check for credits like the EITC and CTC‚Äîrefunds can offset short-term cliffs and stabilize cash flow.\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"mt-3\">üëâ Want a quick read on eligibility? <a href=\"/tools/check-benefits\" className=\"underline\">Check benefits for <City/></a>.</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n> \"It's like the real-life Hunger Games in America.\"  \n> ‚Äî Jessica McBride, Largo, FL  \n(*The Washington Post*, [Shutdown highlights the importance and value of government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2019/01/24/daily-202-an-unintended-consequence-shutdown-highlights-the-importance-and-value-of-government/5c493cc81b326b29c3778ca5/))\n\nMcBride‚Äîa single mother with a housing voucher‚Äîdescribed how a policy shock put her lease at risk.
