    "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nMany families in need of food assistance have heard of **WIC** and **SNAP**, but few understand how they differ â€” or that you can actually use both at the same time. These programs are designed to **supplement** your nutrition needs, and knowing how they work can help you make the most of available support.\n\n## What Is SNAP?\n\nThe **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**, often called food stamps, provides monthly funds for eligible individuals and families to buy groceries. Benefits are loaded onto an **EBT card** and can be used at most grocery stores and farmers markets.\n\nSNAP benefits can be used to buy:\n\n- Fruits and vegetables\n- Meat, poultry, and fish\n- Dairy products and bread\n- Non-alcoholic beverages\n\nYou **cannot** use SNAP for hot foods, alcohol, or non-food items.\n\n## What Is WIC?\n\n**WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)** is a separate program aimed at supporting:\n\n1. Pregnant and postpartum women\n2. Infants\n3. Children up to age 5\n\nUnlike SNAP, WIC provides **specific foods** that meet nutritional guidelines (like baby formula, milk, whole grains), along with **nutrition education**, **health referrals**, and even **breastfeeding support**.\n\nBenefits are given through WIC cards or checks and can only be used on approved items.\n\n## Can You Get Both WIC and SNAP?\n\nYes â€” **you can apply for and use both** programs if you meet the eligibility criteria. In fact, many families do.\n\nHereâ€™s how to do it:\n\n1. **Apply for SNAP** through your stateâ€™s benefits portal\n2. **Apply for WIC** through your local WIC office or clinic\n3. **Use both EBT and WIC cards** as needed â€” stores will usually process WIC first, then SNAP\n\nEach program has its own income limits and requirements, so qualifying for one does **not** automatically qualify you for the other.\n\n## Key Differences at a Glance\n\n- **SNAP** is for a wide range of low-income individuals and families  \n- **WIC** is for women and young children only  \n- **SNAP** provides monthly dollars to spend  \n- **WIC** provides a set list of approved healthy items  \n- **SNAP** is managed by the USDA through state agencies  \n- **WIC** is managed locally by health departments and clinics  \n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Applying for both programs together can stretch your food budget further â€” and WICâ€™s nutrition support is often overlooked but very helpful.\n\n***\n\n###### References\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USDA â€“ WIC Program</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USDA â€“ SNAP Program</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.benefits.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Benefits.gov â€“ Program Finder</a>",
