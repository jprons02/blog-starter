    "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nEviction is a terrifying possibility ‚Äî especially when you're already struggling to catch up on rent. The **Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA)** program was created to help renters facing financial hardship. If you‚Äôre behind on rent or at risk of losing your housing, this program could help cover not only your rent but also utilities and late fees.\n\n<BenefitsCtaBanner />\n\n***\n\n## What Is Emergency Rental Assistance?\n\nERA is a federal program funded by the U.S. Treasury and administered by **state, county, or city agencies**. It was launched during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to provide aid in many areas.\n\nFunds can be used to cover:\n\n- Past-due rent\n- Future rent (up to 3 months in some cases)\n- Utility and home energy costs\n- Late fees and relocation costs (in certain cases)\n\n## Who Qualifies for ERA?\n\nTo be eligible, you typically need to:\n\n1. Have **experienced financial hardship** (loss of job, reduced hours, unexpected expenses)\n2. Show a **risk of housing instability or eviction**\n3. Have **household income at or below 80% of the area median**\n\nEligibility varies by location, and some areas give priority to very low-income renters or households with children.\n\n## How to Apply for ERA\n\nApplication processes differ by city or state, but follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Search for your local ERA program** via the Consumer Finance ERA finder\n2. **Gather documents** like your lease, ID, income info, and overdue rent notices\n3. **Apply online or through a housing agency**\n4. **Follow up** quickly ‚Äî some programs run out of funds or close applications periodically\n\nPayments often go directly to your landlord or utility provider.\n\n## Tips for Renters\n\n- **Communicate with your landlord**: Let them know you‚Äôve applied for assistance\n- **Apply even if partially behind**: Some programs help proactively\n- **Check for reopening periods**: If the application is closed now, it may reopen later\n\n> üí° **Tip:** Many renters assume ERA is ‚Äúonly for COVID‚Äù ‚Äî but some programs are still active and open to anyone with documented hardship. Don‚Äôt wait to check.\n\n***\n\n###### References\n\n<a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/renthelp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFPB ‚Äì Emergency Rental Assistance Finder</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/assistance-for-state-local-and-tribal-governments/emergency-rental-assistance-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Treasury ‚Äì ERA Program Info</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.211.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">211.org ‚Äì Local Housing Assistance</a>",
