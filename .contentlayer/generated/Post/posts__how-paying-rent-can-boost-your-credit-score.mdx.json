    "raw": "\n## Make your rent work for you‚Äîturn those on-time payments into credit history\n\nPaying rent every month is one of your biggest bills; with the right setup, it can also be the habit that starts (or strengthens) your credit profile. <IfLocation>In <City/>, <State/>, reporting paths and fees may vary‚Äîcheck local options before you enroll.</IfLocation>\n\n<AffiliateCtaBanner affiliate=\"boom\" />\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"not-prose my-12 p-4 rounded-xl border-[3px] bg-muted\">\n  <p className=\"mb-2\"><strong>Quick links for <City/>, <State/>:</strong></p>\n  <ul className=\"list-disc ml-5 space-y-1\">\n    <li><ResourceLink name=\"creditScore\" field=\"contact\">Local rental assistance programs</ResourceLink></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n## Start here: what to do first\n\n- **Ask your landlord or property manager** if they already report rent to any credit bureau. If yes, confirm which bureaus and how to enroll.\n- **If they don‚Äôt, compare rent-reporting services.** Look for fees (setup/monthly), which bureaus they report to, whether they need landlord verification, and whether they can add past payments.\n- **Document your payments.** Use a traceable method (bank transfer, money order with receipt, or app) and save confirmations in a single folder.\n- **Pull your credit reports** from all three bureaus and set a reminder to check again in ~60‚Äì90 days to verify rent is showing up.\n- **Automate on-time habits.** Autopay (with a few-days cushion) plus calendar reminders reduces the chance of a late payment.\n\n## Which credit scores actually count your rent‚Äîand when they don‚Äôt\n\nSmall but important detail: **rent helps only if your payments reach the credit bureaus** and you‚Äôre scored by a model that uses that data.\n\n*Scenario:* You enroll in a rent-reporting service and your on-time payments start posting. Your VantageScore may move first, while some lenders still use older FICO versions that ignore rent‚Äîso you see improvements in some places before others.\n\n- **Models that can use rent:** several newer credit models can include verified rental tradelines when present.\n- **Mortgages vs. everything else:** many non-mortgage lenders adopt newer models faster than the mortgage market, so effects may show up sooner for credit cards or auto than for home loans.\n- **Thin file gains:** people with limited history often see the biggest lift because rent adds a long, consistent tradeline.\n- **Verification matters:** self-reported data usually isn‚Äôt counted; verified feeds from landlords or approved providers are.\n- **Expect timing gaps:** it can take weeks for the first tradeline to post and longer for scores to update everywhere.\n\n<CrossLink href=\"./what-credit-score-do-you-need-to-rent-a-home\">What Credit Score Do You Need to Rent a Home?</CrossLink>\n\n## Getting your payments into the bureaus: landlord opt-in vs. rent-reporting services\n\nThere are two main paths to make rent ‚Äúcount‚Äù: your housing provider reports it, or you use a third-party service.\n\n*Scenario:* Your property manager partners with a credit-building vendor and invites residents to opt in at no cost; your payments flow automatically each month. Alternatively, you live in a small building and use a service that verifies your lease and bank records.\n\n- **Landlord-reported feeds** are the cleanest path: they typically verify your lease and payment directly in the property system.\n- **Third-party services** can work when your landlord doesn‚Äôt participate; some require landlord confirmation, others can verify through bank statements.\n- **Which bureaus?** Coverage varies; aim for services that report to multiple bureaus to widen the impact.\n- **Back-reporting:** some providers can add 6‚Äì24 months of prior on-time payments‚Äîhelpful for a faster ‚Äúthick‚Äù history.\n- **Positive-only vs. full file:** certain programs send only on-time payments (misses aren‚Äôt reported), while others may report delinquencies; know the rules before you opt in.\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"mt-3\">üëâ Want a quick read on eligibility? <a href=\"/tools/check-benefits\" className=\"underline\">Check benefits for <City/></a>.</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n---\n\n<IfLocation>\n  <h2>Rent Reporting FAQs for <City/>, <State/></h2>\n  <ResourceLink name=\"rentReporting\" field=\"faqs\" />\n</IfLocation>\n\n<IfNoLocation>\n## FAQs\n\n### How long before I see changes?\nTypically a few weeks for the tradeline to appear and 1‚Äì3 months for scores to refresh consistently across bureaus and apps.\n\n### What if I pay rent in cash?\nYou‚Äôll need verifiable proof (e.g., money order stubs, receipts, or bank withdrawals tied to rent). Many services can‚Äôt use unverified cash payments.\n\n### Can roommates report, too?\nYes‚Äîif their name is on the lease and the provider can verify their payments. Each person usually enrolls separately.\n\n### Will a single late payment tank my score?\nPrograms differ. Some send only on-time data; others may report delinquencies. Read the terms before opting in and set safeguards like autopay.\n</IfNoLocation>\n\n---\n###### References\n\n<div className=\"references\">\n<a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFPB ‚Äî Credit reports and scores overview</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://multifamily.fanniemae.com/positive-rent-payment-impact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae ‚Äî Positive Rent Payment: Impact and data</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://multifamily.fanniemae.com/financing-options/equity-initiatives/positive-rent-payment/information-renters-positive-rent-payment-reporting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae ‚Äî Information for renters on Positive Rent Payment</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.experian.com/rental-property-solutions/rentbureau\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Experian ‚Äî RentBureau (rental payment database)</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.transunion.com/blog/rental-reporting-a-lever-for-promoting-financial-inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TransUnion ‚Äî Rental reporting & financial inclusion</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/evaluating-rent-reporting-pathway-build-credit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Urban Institute ‚Äî Evaluating rent reporting as a pathway to build credit</a>\n</div>\n\n<AffiliateDisclosure />",
