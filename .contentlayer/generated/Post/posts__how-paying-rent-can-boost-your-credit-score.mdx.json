But unless your rent is being reported to the credit bureaus, it **won’t help your credit score**.\n\nThe good news is, there are now several ways to **report your rent and build credit** without taking on debt or opening a credit card.\n\n<AffiliateCtaBanner affiliate=\"boom\" />\n\n***\n\n## Why Rent Reporting Matters\n\nMost landlords don’t report rent to credit bureaus by default — which means even if you’ve paid on time for years, your credit file won’t reflect it.\n\nBut by using **rent reporting services**, you can:\n\n- Establish credit if you don’t have any  \n- Rebuild credit after hardship or debt  \n- Improve your credit score to qualify for housing or loans\n\n## How Rent Reporting Works\n\nYou (or your landlord) enroll in a service that verifies rent payments and reports them to one or more of the major credit bureaus: **Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax**.\n\nSome popular services include:\n\n- **RentReporters**  \n- **Rental Kharma**  \n- **Self (rent + credit builder loans)**  \n- **LevelCredit**  \n- **Esusu** (used by many property managers)\n\nMost services charge a monthly or annual fee — usually $7 to $10/month — though some landlords cover the cost.\n\n> 💡 **Tip:** Reporting rent can’t hurt your credit. It only helps if payments are on time, and missed payments usually aren’t reported.\n\n## Who Should Use Rent Reporting?\n\nRent reporting is especially helpful if you:\n\n- Have **little or no credit history**  \n- Are trying to **rebuild your score** after financial trouble  \n- Plan to **apply for a loan**, credit card, or new housing soon  \n- Can’t get approved for a secured card\n\nIf you're also behind on rent or worried about eviction, look into [Emergency Rental Assistance](./emergency-rental-assistance-what-it-is-and-how-to-apply-before-it-s-gone) first.\n\n## How to Get Started\n\n1. **Consider a service like [Boom](https://www.boompay.app/boomreport?source=MYGOVBLOG)** — they make it easy to report rent payments and even offer the option to back-report up to 24 months for a stronger credit boost\n2. **Ask your landlord or property manager** if they already use a rent reporting system  \n3. **Choose a rent reporting service** and enroll (some allow self-reporting)  \n4. **Verify your lease and past payments**  \n5. **Check your credit report** after a few months to see the impact\n\nSome services even let you report up to 24 months of past rent to give your credit file a head start.\n\n## Tips for Building Credit Safely\n\n- **Start small**: Avoid high-interest loans or sketchy “credit repair” ads  \n- **Monitor your credit**: Use free tools from your bank or [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/)  \n- **Pay all bills on time**: Utility and phone bill history may also help your credit if reported\n\n> 💡 **Bonus Tip:** If you're already budgeting rent carefully, rent reporting is one of the **easiest low-risk ways** to build credit — no new debt required.\n\n***\n\n###### References\n\n<div className=\"references\">\n<a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/does-late-rent-affect-my-credit-score-en-1815/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CFPB – Does Late Rent Affect My Credit Score?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-choose-rent-reporting-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Experian – How to Choose a Rent Reporting Service</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-desktop-originator/positive-rent-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fannie Mae – Positive Rent Payment History in Underwriting</a>\n</div>\n\n<AffiliateDisclosure />",
