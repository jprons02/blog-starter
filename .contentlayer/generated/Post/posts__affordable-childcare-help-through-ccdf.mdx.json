    "raw": "\n## Introduction\n\nChildcare can cost more than rent in many cities ‚Äî and it‚Äôs one of the biggest barriers for low-income families trying to work, go to school, or get back on their feet.\n\nBut if you're struggling to afford daycare or after-school care, there's help available. The **Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF)** is a government program that can pay part (or all) of your childcare costs depending on your income and situation.\n\n<BenefitsCtaBanner />\n\n***\n\n## What Is CCDF?\n\nThe **Child Care and Development Fund** is a federal program that provides money to states to help families pay for childcare. It‚Äôs often run under different names at the state level, like ‚ÄúChild Care Assistance Program‚Äù or ‚ÄúSubsidized Child Care.‚Äù\n\nCCDF funds can be used for:\n\n- Licensed daycare centers\n- Family child care homes\n- Approved relatives or in-home providers\n- After-school programs\n\nPayments usually go directly to the provider, and many families just pay a small copay or nothing at all.\n\n## Who Qualifies for Child Care Assistance?\n\nEligibility varies by state, but in general you must:\n\n1. Be **working, in school, or in job training**\n2. Have a **child under age 13** (or under 19 if disabled)\n3. Have **low or moderate income** (usually under 85% of state median income)\n\nMany states prioritize:\n\n- Families with very young children\n- Single parents\n- Families experiencing homelessness\n- Parents transitioning off TANF or other benefits\n\n## How to Apply for Child Care Help\n\nApplication processes differ by state, but here‚Äôs how to start:\n\n1. **Find your state‚Äôs child care subsidy office** (search ‚Äú[your state] child care assistance‚Äù)\n2. **Gather documents**: proof of income, work/school schedule, child‚Äôs age, and provider info\n3. **Submit an application** online or through a local agency\n4. **Follow up** and complete interviews if required\n\nSome states have waitlists, so apply early and ask about temporary coverage while waiting.\n\nFamilies who qualify may also be eligible for [WIC](./wic-vs-snap-what-s-the-difference-and-can-you-get-both).\n## Tips for Parents\n\n- **Choose your provider wisely**: Not all childcare options are approved ‚Äî make sure they‚Äôre licensed or registered\n- **Ask about emergency coverage**: Some states offer expedited help for newly employed parents\n- **Keep reapplying**: Many subsidies require re-certification every 6‚Äì12 months\n\n> üí° **Tip:** Even if you think you make ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù check your state‚Äôs income limits. Many middle-income families still qualify ‚Äî especially with multiple kids or part-time work.\n\n***\n\n###### References\n\n<div className=\"references\">\n<a href=\"https://childcare.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ChildCare.gov ‚Äì Child Care Assistance by State</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/occ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Office of Child Care ‚Äì CCDF Information</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/615\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Benefits.gov ‚Äì Child Care and Development Fund</a>\n</div>\n",
