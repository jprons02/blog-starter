The most important thing is to separate **paused programs** from **programs that still count your progress**.\n\n- Stay enrolled in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan if you qualify, even if parts of forgiveness are temporarily blocked.\n- Keep making required payments unless your servicer confirms a forbearance in writing.\n- Save copies of payment histories, employment certifications, and servicer messages.\n- Ignore unsolicited calls or emails promising “guaranteed” forgiveness for a fee.\n- Check your Federal Student Aid account regularly for official notices—not just servicer emails.\n\n<CrossLink href=\"./how-to-apply-for-snap-benefits-food-stamps-without-the-confusion\">How to Apply for SNAP Benefits (Food Stamps) — Without the Confusion</CrossLink>\n\n## Court rulings, pauses, and pivots: what actually changed in the last few months\nA key non-obvious detail from recent litigation is that **courts have targeted specific forgiveness paths—not the entire repayment system**.\n\n*Example:* A borrower on an IDR plan may still earn credit toward forgiveness even while a particular plan’s cancellation authority is frozen.\n\n- Parts of the SAVE plan’s forgiveness provisions were paused by federal courts in 2024–2025.\n- Monthly payment calculations under IDR often continued, even when forgiveness timing became unclear.\n- Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) remained rooted in statute, making it harder to fully dismantle.\n- One-time account adjustments credited past payments for many long-time borrowers.\n- Confusion increased because servicers applied pauses unevenly across accounts.\n\n## The money math most people miss: how delays quietly raise long-term costs\nThe biggest hidden risk isn’t losing forgiveness outright—it’s **time**.\n\n*Example:* A borrower earning $38,000 may owe $0 per month under IDR, but a missed recertification can trigger a higher bill and reset interest subsidies.\n\n- Missed income recertification can push you into a standard plan temporarily.\n- Interest may capitalize during certain administrative changes.\n- Forbearance can pause payments but still allow balances to grow.\n- Delays disproportionately affect borrowers with smaller balances but longer timelines.\n- Older borrowers nearing forgiveness are often hit hardest by last-minute rule changes.\n\n## Why servicer bottlenecks matter more than politics right now\nEven when rules technically favor borrowers, **capacity problems** can block access.\n\n*Example:* During recent transitions, some servicers took months to process simple IDR updates, leaving borrowers in limbo.\n\n- Staffing shortages slowed form processing and call response times.\n- Automated systems lagged behind policy changes.\n- Incorrect bills were common after repayment restarts.\n- Written complaints created paper trails that helped resolve errors.\n- Borrowers who escalated early often avoided months of overbilling.\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"mt-3\">👉 Want a quick read on eligibility? <a href=\"/tools/check-benefits\" className=\"underline\">Check benefits for <City/>, <State/></a>.</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n> “The reality is, is that the SAVE plan was created because the other plans were unaffordable for millions of borrowers.
