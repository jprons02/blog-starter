The truth: most places don‚Äôt use a single cutoff. Here‚Äôs how credit fits into screening‚Äîand what to do if you‚Äôre not at 700.\n\n<AffiliateCtaBanner affiliate=\"boom\" />\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"not-prose my-12 p-4 rounded-xl border-[3px] bg-muted\">\n  <p className=\"mb-2\"><strong>Quick links for <City/>, <State/>:</strong></p>\n  <ul className=\"list-disc ml-5 space-y-1\">\n    <li><ResourceLink name=\"creditScore\" field=\"contact\">Local rental assistance programs</ResourceLink></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n## Start here: what to do first\n\n- List your strengths: stable income (typically 2.5‚Äì3√ó rent), on-time bill history, solid references, no evictions, clean criminal court records. You‚Äôll use this to balance a ‚Äújust-OK‚Äù score.\n- Pull your own credit reports and fix errors before you apply (disputes can remove wrong addresses, duplicate collections, or paid debts).\n- Build a simple ‚Äúrenter packet‚Äù: ID, last 3 pay stubs, offer letter or benefits award, last 2 bank statements, past landlord contacts, and a 1‚Äì2 paragraph cover note explaining anything unusual.\n- Have plan B ready: a co-signer/guarantor, larger deposit, or a few months of rent in savings can offset a middling score.\n- If you‚Äôre credit invisible/thin file, bring proof of positive history (on-time utilities, phone, or rent receipts) and consider rent-reporting to build score over time.\n\n## There‚Äôs usually no hard minimum: how rental risk scoring actually works\n\n**Tiny scenario:** Two applicants both show ‚Äú650.‚Äù One has medical collections from years ago but steady income and clean rentals; the other has recent missed payments and high debt. The first may get approved faster.\n\n- Property managers may use **rental-specific models** (e.g., a ‚Äúresident score‚Äù) that weigh factors differently than standard credit scores.\n- Many screens look at **patterns**‚Äîrecent delinquencies, high credit utilization, or unresolved collections matter more than an old paid account.\n- Income and **debt-to-income** can weigh heavily; some buildings require a specific income multiple regardless of score.\n- **Evictions/judgments** and open bankruptcies are bigger red flags than a single low number.\n- Expect variation by **market and building class**: corporate-managed buildings may set higher thresholds than small landlords.\n- If you‚Äôre denied, you have a right to an **adverse action notice** telling you which report/score was used and how to request it.\n\n## Renting with less-than-perfect credit: practical ways to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù\n\n**Tiny scenario:** Your score is 605 after a rough patch. You offer a co-signer, provide two months‚Äô bank statements showing cash cushion, and agree to enroll in autopay; the landlord approves with a slightly higher deposit.\n\n- **Strengthen the file:** stable income letters, proof of emergency savings, and clean rental history references.\n- **Offer risk-reducers:** larger deposit (where legal), a few months‚Äô rent upfront, autopay, or a **co-signer/guarantor** (understand fees and obligations).\n- **Target the right listings:** smaller owners may review the whole story; large complexes may be stricter but offer ‚Äúconditional approvals.‚Äù\n- **Time your application:** apply right after a paycheck hits and credit utilization dips (balances lower = often a small score bump).\n- **Explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù:** a brief, factual note about medical bills, divorce, or a one-time lapse‚Äîpaired with proof of current stability‚Äîcan matter.\n- **Build as you go:** enroll in **rent reporting** so on-time payments help your profile for future moves.\n\n<IfLocation>\n<div className=\"mt-3\">üëâ Want a quick read on eligibility? <a href=\"/tools/check-benefits\" className=\"underline\">Check benefits for <City/></a>.</div>\n</IfLocation>\n\n---\n\n<IfLocation>\n  <h2>FAQs for <City/>, <State/></h2>\n  <ResourceLink name=\"rentReporting\" field=\"faqs\" />\n</IfLocation>\n\n<IfNoLocation>\n## FAQs \n### Is 600 enough to rent?\nOften, yes‚Äîespecially with strong income, clean rental history, or added safeguards (co-signer, larger deposit).

Expect variation; decisions also consider your full report and income.\n\n### Can I get approved with no credit history?\nSometimes.
